The macroeconomics projections up to 2030 are then used to generate energy
demand functions using the regression software Microfit2. The energy demand
functions generated then is used to estimate the final energy demand and supply
projections and GHG emissions for the energy sector.
3.3.2 Summary of GHG Emission Projection Results
The projection indicates that the total emissions without LULUCF for Malaysia would
be 481,363 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM case by 2030 (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.5).
Continued implementation of the planned activities under the WEM scenario would
bring the emissions down to 367,603 Gg CO2 eq. If further mitigation activities under
the WAM scenario are carried out, the GHG emissions could reduce to 337,554 Gg
CO2 eq. The mitigation assumptions for each of the scenarios and sectors are
described in section 3.3.3.

Figure 3.1: Projected Greenhouse Gas Emission Time Series for WOM, WEM
and WAM Scenarios

The energy sector is projected to continue to be the largest contributor of GHG
emissions in 2030 followed by the IPPU and waste sectors. For the WEM scenario
without LULUCF, the GHG emissions from the energy sector is likely to be 80% of the
total emissions in 2030. This is followed by the IPPU sector at around 11%, the waste
sector at about 6% and the agriculture sector at 3%. For the WAM scenario without
LULUCF, the energy sector is likely to account for 78% of the emissions in 2030. This
is followed by the IPPU sector at 13%, the waste sector at 7% and the agriculture
sector at 3%.
