1.17 Institutional Arrangements
The institutional arrangements support three key areas of climate change action:
policy making, development planning and implementation, and guidance and
reporting. It should be highlighted that since the Third National Communication (NC3),
Malaysia had experienced three rounds of changes in Government and ministerial
restructuring. Changes during the first two rounds were reported in the Third Biennial
Update Report (submitted December 2020) and the latest round being the most recent
change in federal power which is detailed below.
1.17.1 Restructuring of Ministries in 2022
Following the results of the 15th General Election in November 2022, the two key
ministries for climate change were merged. The Ministry of Environment and Water,
which was the focal point ministry to the UNFCCC since 2020 and the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources were combined to form the Ministry of Natural
Resources, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC). Subsequently, as of the end
of December 2023, it underwent further transformation into the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES). This ministry now takes on the
role of the national focal point for climate change within the UNFCCC framework.
In addition, several ministries and the central planning agency had undergone
restructuring and/or renaming as listed below:
(a) Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries to Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security;
(b) Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs to Ministry of Domestic Trade
and Cost of Living;
(c) Ministry of Housing and Local Government to Ministry of Local Government
Development;
32
(d) Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities to Ministry of Plantation and
Commodities; and
(e) Economic Planning Unit, Prime Ministerâ€™s Department to Ministry of Economy.
1.17.2 Policy Making
The Malaysia Climate Change Action Council (MyCAC) was established to address
the policy direction of climate change in December 2020. It is chaired by the Prime
Minister and has key Cabinet Ministers and state leaders as members.
The Cabinet is the highest policy decision-making body in the country on climate
change matters under the purview of the Minister of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sustainability (NRES). Any decisions taken at the MyCAC and other
bodies require a final endorsement by the Cabinet.
1.17.3 Development Planning and Implementation
Development planning and implementation is coordinated by the Ministry of Economy
in consultation with other Ministries. These are carried out through the five-year
development plans and include climate change mitigation and adaptation
programmes. Table 1.33 shows the coordinating Ministries and their respective
implementing agencies for key sectors.

1.17.4 Guidance and Reporting
The National Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC)
Operational matters on climate change are guided and endorsed by the National
Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC) chaired by the Secretary General
of NRES. The coordination for the preparation of national communications (NCs) and
biennial update reports (BURs) is under the Technical Committee on Climate Change
(TCCC) which reports to the NSCCC.
The secretariat to these committees is the Climate Change Division of NRES which is
also the national focal point for climate change to the UNFCCC. The technical work of
the NCs and BURs is carried out through six Technical Working Groups (TWGs)
established under the TCCC. Figure 1.10 shows the institutional arrangement and
thematic groupings to address climate change and NC/BUR reporting.
