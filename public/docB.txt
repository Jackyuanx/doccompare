EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Malaysia’s Fourth National Communication (NC4) is prepared according to the
guidance United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Decision
17/CP.8. The report provides information on National Circumstances, National
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory, Mitigation Assessment, Vulnerability Assessment
and Adaptation Measures, Research and Systematic Observation, Capacity-building,
Education, Public Awareness, Information-sharing and Networking and Constraints,
Gaps, Level of Support Received and Needs.
The chapter on Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Measures is concurrently
submitted as Malaysia’s First Adaptation Communication pursuant to the Paris
Agreement, which was prepared taking into account Decision 9/CMA.1.
1. National Circumstances
Information on the country’s national circumstances up to the year 2019 was provided
where relevant geography, climate, natural resources, social and economic published
statistics were available. The chapter also communicates the status of key climaterelated sectors and their respective policies and strategic measures as well as
Malaysia’s political system and climate governance structure.
Malaysia is located in the Southeast Asia region and lies between 0º 51’ N and 7º 33’
N, and 98º 01’ E and 119º 30’ E. It has a land area of 330,241 km 2 with about 8,840
km of coastline. It has a tropical maritime climate and consistent with global warming
trends, there has been a surface mean temperature increase of 0.13 ⁰C to 0.24 ⁰C per
decade in the past 50 years. For the same period of half a century, annual rainfall
averages about 2,000 mm to 4,000 mm with a slight downward trend for Peninsular
Malaysia and Sabah while in Sarawak, there is a slight increasing trend.
Between 1986 and 2021, the average annual sea level rise in Peninsular Malaysia
was 3.2 mm per annum while from 1988 to 2021 it was 2.9 mm per annum for Sabah.
Sarawak and the Federal Territory of Labuan.
Malaysia has upheld its voluntary pledge of maintaining 50% of its landmass as forest
since the 1992 Earth Summit and in 2019, approximately 54.9% of the land remained
forested. As a mega biodiverse country, terrestrial biodiversity is supported by the high
forest cover while aquatic biodiversity is found in the varied marine ecosystems.
Malaysia’s population has been growing quite steadily in the past 15 years, reaching
32.5mil in 2019. Population density increased from 79 person per km 2 in 2005 to 99
persons per km2 in 2019. The national urbanisation rate grew from 51.4% in 1990 to
76.2% in 2019. In 2019, 23.5% of the population was under 15 years old, 69.8% were
between the ages of 15 and 64, and a smaller percentage of 6.7% were over 65 years
old. Female life expectancy has increased to 77.4 years in 2019 from 76.0 years in
2005 while male life expectancy increased marginally from 71.4 years in 2005 to 72.5
years in 2019.
xxii
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 2015 constant prices grew from RM729.85 billion
in 2005 to RM1,423.95 billion in 2019. The main contributing sectors were services
(58.3%), manufacturing (22.5%), mining and quarrying (7.3%), agriculture, livestock,
forestry and fishery (7.2%) and construction (4.7%).
The energy sector is anticipated to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and
sustainable energy, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 7 of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. The National Energy Policy 2022 – 2040, introduced in
September 2022 underscores the commitment towards energy transformation with a
focus to shift from fossil-based systems of production and consumption to renewable
energy. The policy aligns the energy sector to the country’s long-term plan of Shared
Prosperity Vision 2030 and its five Key Economic Growth Activities which are directly
related to the energy sector (such as sustainable mobility, renewable energy and
green economy). The policy aims to spur new energy-related sectors which will also
support the goal of reducing dependence on petroleum-based revenue and commodity
trade, enhancing the resilience of the country’s fiscal and economic position in the
process. The policy also sets the directive towards Low Carbon Nation Aspiration 2040
from the improvement of primary energy mix intensity through increased penetration
of clean and renewable sources of energy. This is in line with the Government’s target
to reach 31% of RE installed capacity mix by 2025.
For the transport sector, the Land Public Transport Agency (APAD) is tasked with
‘spearheading the transformation of an integrated, efficient and safe transportation
system’. A National Transport Policy (2019-2030) was launched to increase the public
transport modal share (40% by 2030) in urban areas while also implementing
sustainable measures across all transport modes. Towards this end, the rail network
is crucial to the Malaysia's transport system as it enables greater domestic mobility.
By the end of 2016, there were five urban rail network lines serving the Greater Kuala
Lumpur area namely KTM Komuter, LRT Ampang Line, LRT Kelana Jaya Line, KL
Monorail and the MRT.
In the agriculture sector, sustainable development is a key principle in both the food
production and commodity sub-sectors. Oil palm remains the most economically
important crop followed by rubber. Paddy is also an important agricultural crop and the
planted areas of 672,000 hectares as of 2019 involved double cropping. Livestock
population size fluctuation across all animal types has largely remain stable between
2015 and 2019. Landings of marine fish in Malaysia has had a slight increase from
1.21 million tonnes in 2005 to 1.45 million tonnes in 2019. Aquaculture production in
Malaysia increased from 207,000 tonnes in 2005 to 412,000 tonnes in 2019.
According to the latest national survey in 2012, Malaysians generate 33,10 tonnes per
day of waste on average. There were 19 sanitary and 119 non-sanitary landfills in the
country in 2019.
Finally, in terms of institutional arrangement, the Malaysia Climate Change Action
Council (MyCAC) was established to address the policy direction of climate change in
December 2020. It is chaired by the Prime Minister and has key Cabinet Ministers and
state leaders as members.
xxiii
The Cabinet is the highest policy decision-making body in the country on climate
change matters under the purview of the Minister of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sustainability (NRES). Any decisions taken at the MyCAC and other
bodies require a final endorsement by the Cabinet.
Development planning and implementation is coordinated by the Ministry of Economy
in consultation with other Ministries. These are carried out through the five-year
development plans and include climate change mitigation and adaptation
programmes.
Operational matters on climate change are guided and endorsed by the National
Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC) chaired by the Secretary General
of NRES. The coordination for the preparation of National Communications (NCs) and
Biennial Update Reports (BURs) is under the Technical Committee on Climate
Change (TCCC) which reports to the NSCCC. The secretariat to these committees is
the Climate Change Division of NRES which is also the national focal point for climate
change to the UNFCCC. The technical work of the NCs and BURs is carried out
through six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) established under the TCCC.
2. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Malaysia’s national GHG inventory in 2019 using the IPCC AR4 100-year time horizon
global warming potential (GWP) values is as follows:
Sector
Energy
IPPU
AFOLU-Agriculture
AFOLU-LULUCF
Waste
Total (Excluding LULUCF)
Total (Including LULUCF)
GHG Emissions
(Gg CO2 eq.)
259,326.11
32,853.80
9,921.71
-214,714.54
28,256.59
330,358.21
115,643.68
Excluding LULUCF, the total GHG emissions in 2019 was 330,358.21 Gg CO2 eq. The
energy sector continued to be the largest emitter of GHG where it accounted for 78%
of the total emissions. This is followed by the IPPU and the waste sectors, at about
10% and 9% of the total emissions respectively. The agriculture sector contributed the
lowest emissions at 3%. About 81% of the total GHG emissions were in the form of
CO2, followed by CH4 at 15% and N2O and F-gases at about 2% each respectively.
Taking into account the LULUCF sector which shows a net sink of -214,714.54 Gg
CO2 eq., Malaysia’s net GHG emissions was 115,643.68 Gg CO2 eq.
Comparison was also carried out between using IPCC AR4 100-year time horizon and
IPCC AR5 100-year time horizon GWP for the 2019 GHG inventory. The total CO2 eq.
GHG emission is slightly higher using AR5 GWPs compared to using AR4 GWPs.
Excluding LULUCF, the total 2019 GHG emission was 335,059.05 Gg CO2 eq. using
xxiv
AR5 GWPs compared to 330,358.21 Gg CO2 eq. using AR4 GWPs, giving a difference
of 1.42%. Including LULUCF, the total 2019 GHG emission was 120,344.51 Gg CO2
eq. using AR5 GWPs compared to 115,643.68 Gg CO2 eq. using AR4 GWPs, giving
a difference of 4.06%. By sector, the largest difference of 11.64% was observed in the
waste sector due to the higher AR5 GWP value of 28 for methane (CH4) compared to
the AR4 GWP value of 25.
The GHG emission time series from 1990 to 2019 (based on IPCC AR4 100-year time
horizon GWP) is shown below. As part of the efforts to improve the GHG estimations
to the extent possible, recalculations were undertaken and reported in all the sectors
as data became available. The energy sector remained the main source of GHG
emissions while the LULUCF remained the main sink throughout the time series. The
time series indicated that Malaysia’s net total GHG emissions became a net source at
around the 2004 timeline.
3. Mitigation Assessment
During the preparation works of NC4, actual energy data for the year of 2020 was still
in the process of publication by the related agency. Hence, the projection for the year
of 2020 and onwards is based on the pre-COVID-19 condition assumptions.
The updates pertaining to the actual energy data for 2020 and 2021 as well a relatively
updated projection will be reported in the next reporting document e.g. the First
Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1).
The main mitigation actions and their related policies have been highlighted and the
projection exercise were conducted for 3 scenarios. The projection indicates that the
total emissions excluding LULUCF for Malaysia would be 481,363 Gg CO2 eq for the
Without Measures (WOM) case by 2030 continued implementation of the planned
xxv
activities under the With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario would bring the emissions
down to 367,603 Gg CO2 eq. If further mitigation activities under the With Additional
Measures (WAM) scenario are carried out, the GHG emissions could reduce to
337,554 Gg CO2 eq as shown the Figure ES 2.
and WAM Scenarios
With LULUCF, the total emissions would be 260,431 Gg CO2 eq for WOM scenario,
141,883 Gg CO2 eq for the WEM scenario and 105,317 Gg CO2 eq for the WAM
scenario in 2030.
Quantification of mitigation actions will require certain capacity building since certain
policies do not have direct GHG mitigation effects. Hence, the supporting policies have
to be enhanced to strengthen Malaysia’s capability to achieve its Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) target in 2030.
4. Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Measures
The vulnerability assessments of floods, dry spells, sea level rise and coastal
inundations due to climate change reported in this chapter are focused on six sectors,
namely (i) water and coastal resources; (ii) agriculture and food security; (iii) forestry
and biodiversity; (iv) cities, built environment and infrastructure; (v) energy; and (vi)
public health. The current adaptation measures, gaps and improvement plans for each
of the sectors are also elaborated in the chapter.
xxvi
Hydroclimate Data and SLR Projections
The sectoral flood and dry spell vulnerabilities were assessed based on the projected
future hydroclimate data from the Regional Hydro-Climate Model (RegHCM) with
horizontal resolution of 6 km, downscaled from five Global Climate Models (GCMs),
based on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) RCP scenarios. Flood areal extent
maps of the selected 37 major river basins were developed for flood impact
assessment; while the impact of dry spells, extreme dry events and extreme wet
events, indicated by rainfall variability index (RVI), were assessed for the whole
country on a monthly and annual basis. The SLR along the country’s coastlines were
projected using 29 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) based
on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) RCP scenarios. The coastal inundation
maps were then developed for sectoral coastal inundation assessments. In terms of
assessment timelines, the flood assessments were carried out for the baseline timeline
(1971-2000) and the future timeline up to 2100. The dry spell assessments were
carried out for the periods of early-century (2020-2046), mid-century (2047-2073) and
late-century (2074-2100), while the SLRs were assessed for the baseline timeline
(2022), 2050 and 2100. The respective regional distribution values, at the baseline
timeline, of the projected average annual air temperature, average annual rainfall and
SLR used in the assessments, are shown in Table ES 1.

Water and Coastal Resources
For the water and coastal resources sector, climate change vulnerabilities of reservoir
storage and dam security, groundwater security, flood risk management and coastal
erosions, were continually assessed. The projected higher number of water supply
dams affected by dry spells by mid-century and late-century could lead to more water
supply issues in the future, while the higher number of projected water supply dams
affected by extreme wet weather by late-century could result in more downstream
flooding and affecting dam integrity.
Currently, 5,496 flood hotspots have been identified all over the country. Based on the
flood areal extent projections for the 232,001 km 2 of flood prone area in the country,
8.9% of these areas could be at flood risk by 2100, as compared to 6.5% at the
baseline timeline. The number of flood hotspots will certainly be increased in the
future. Flood risk could be further worsened with coastal flooding due to SLR, which
was projected to increase along the country’s coastlines by 2050 and 2100.
SLR is also the major threat to groundwater due to saltwater intrusion into the aquifers.
Preliminary assessments indicate that 44 and 68 out of the 2,017 tube wells assessed
in the country could be vulnerable to SLR by 2030 and 2050, respectively. Coastal
erosion could be envisaged to worsen through SLR inundation. The coastal inundation
estimated based on SLR projections showed that the west coast shorelines of
Peninsular Malaysia could be more vulnerable compared to the east coast shorelines
by 2100. Significant coastal inundations were also projected along the KudatSandakan coastline in Sabah, and the Miri-Bintulu and the Bintulu-Sejingkat coastlines
in Sarawak, for the same timeline.
Agriculture and Food Security
The agriculture and food security assessments covered rice production and planted
area, oil palm planted area, rubber planted area, cocoa cultivation, livestock, and
fisheries and aquaculture. The major rice granary areas of MADA, KADA and IADA
Barat Laut Selangor could face significant reductions in average rice yield productions
of 16.0-39.2% and 7.2-30.1% during the main season and off-season, respectively, by
late-century based on the projected temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. Among
the granaries, the KADA is anticipated to be the most affected granary by dry spells
with projected dry periods from mid-decade of 2020s to late-decade of 2040s.
Assessments on floods at the rice planted areas in Peninsular Malaysia indicated
projected increment of 7,929 ha of flood prone planted areas and 0.46 m flood depth
by 2100, while SLR assessment indicated further additional 10,910 ha and 42,303 ha
of inundation by 2050 and 2100, respectively.
Increments in future flood prone planted areas were also projected for the oil palm and
rubber sector. SLR impact assessment on the planted areas of these commodity crops
also showed increasing trend. Based on the extreme wet weather assessment, rubber
plantations in Pahang are amongst the most affected areas by extreme high rainfall.
Future dry spells were projected to occur in the oil palm planted areas at the Pahang
River basin and Coastal 4 region, and the rubber planted areas at Kedah River basin,
Coastal 12 region, Perak River basin, Muar River basin, Pahang River basin and the
Kelantan River basin. For the cocoa crop, long-term observation is mandatory to
xxviii
assess the impact of climate change on its production. Initial research showed that
temperatures greater than 36oC affects cocoa pod production.
Extreme weather events such as intense rainfalls will lead to emergence of waterrelated diseases affecting livestock. Heat stress due to prolonged dry spells will result
in reductions in productivity and reproductive efficiency of livestock. Local research
found that severe heat stress at a Temperature-Humidity-Index (THI) equals to 93, will
affect milk production of dairy cattle. Further increase in THI readings exceeding 100
can result in livestock mortality.
For fisheries and aquaculture, the freshwater culture systems in Johor and Perak were
projected more prone to floods up to 2100. The systems In Perak could also be
affected with SLR inundations by 2050. In Johor, Kedah and Selangor, the freshwater
culture ponds were projected to have higher risk exposure to SLR by 2100. For
brackish water culture systems, the systems in Terengganu, Negeri Sembilan, Sabah
and Sarawak were projected more prone to SLR by 2100. Assessments of dry spell
indicated that both freshwater and brackish water culture systems at the Kelantan
River basin, Pahang River basin, Linggi River basin and Muar River basin could be
affected with projected prolonged dry spells during some particular years, up to 2050.
Forestry and Biodiversity
In Malaysia, forest fires could be exacerbated by prolonged dry spells lasting at least
four months or more. Assessments of dry spells showed that extra attention and
monitoring needs to be addressed at the peat swamp forest reserves in Peninsular
Malaysia by mid-century and late-century; Sabah, specifically in the Kulamba Wildlife
and Kulamba Wildlife Reserve (Extension), by early-century; and Sarawak, by earlycentury and mid-century. Forests located along the coastlines and coastal areas could
be susceptible to SLR, coastal inundation and salt-water intrusion. Increasing areal
extent of SLR prone mangrove forest reserves, peat swamp forests and inland forest
reserve areas in Peninsular Malaysia from the current timeline (2022) to 2050, and
then to 2100, were projected. A similar trend is anticipated in Sabah and Sarawak.
Terrestrial fauna survival responds to climate change through migration or adaptation.
It was documented that various species of moth native have migrated to Mount
Kinabalu uphill, following temperature zones as a consequence of global warming.
Genetic isolation due to degradation of surrounding environment may cause
extinctions of some local terrestrial fauna populations over a long-term period. The
loss of ecological connectivity due to fragmentation of forest has affected animal and
plant populations, where over time could increase their vulnerabilities to climate
change. Unexpected forest fires due to prolonged dry spell also threaten the terrestrial
fauna. However, the direct impact of climate change on terrestrial fauna biodiversity
and the ecosystem health is still unclear.
For the marine ecosystems, the annual coral reef health survey conducted in 2021
showed improvements in reef health with a “fair” level of average live coral cover of
44.26%. As such, periodic site closures could be recommended and mandatory as a
management improvement recovery measure in future. In Sabah, the decline of
hawksbill turtles is a disturbing sign observed at the Turtle Island Park due to the loss
of the nesting beach, which had suffered severe beach erosion. Further research on
xxix
impact of SLR on the marine mammals at Tun Mustapha Park needs to be conducted
and advised.
Cities, Built Environment and Infrastructure
According to PLANMalaysia, as of 2022, there are 281 towns and cities in Peninsular
Malaysia. In the rainy seasons, evening flash floods are common in the towns and
cities in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia; whilst, over at the east coast, floods
brought about by the north-east monsoon are the more common flood events.
Assessment of floods in these towns and cities indicated that 86 and 96 of them, are
flood prone at baseline timeline (1971-2000) and up to 2100, respectively. The
projected floods could also affect 75,927 ha of the built environment areas in
Peninsular Malaysia at baseline timeline (1971-2000), and this is expected to increase
to 96,563 ha up to 2100. The SLR assessments indicated that 111 towns and cities
along the coastlines are prone to SLR at current timeline (2022) and by 2050, and this
number is expected to increase to 116 by 2100. There was about 50,200 ha of built
environment assessed to be affected by SLR at current timeline (2022). At the future
timeline scenarios, the affected areas were projected to increase to 65,917 ha by 2050
and 99,774 ha by 2100. Malaysia had in early century also experienced dry spells a
number of times. This was also indicated by the dry spell assessments where 25 towns
and cities were projected to face extreme dry weather in early-century. The projected
number is expected to reach 57 and 68 by mid-century and late-century, respectively.
It is also estimated that 51,373 ha of built environment areas are prone to dry spells in
early-century, and could increase to 203,024 ha by mid-century and 229,140 ha by
late-century.
Assessments of the impact of climate change on infrastructure is centred on roads,
rails, ports and jetties, and airports. At the baseline timeline (1971-2000), there were
about 1,111 km of roads and highways projected prone to floods, including the Pan
Borneo Highway in Sabah and Sarawak, and this is expected to increase to 1,325 km
up to 2100. Floods could also affect 20 railway stations with about 183.5 km of railway
section length, up to 2100. The majority of the airports in Sabah and Sarawak, and
some airports in Peninsular Malaysia, were projected as flood prone, at both timelines.
The SLR assessments indicated that some stretches of the coastal roads, highways
and railways in Peninsular Malaysia are vulnerable to SLR throughout the century.
There were 21 and 22 ports and jetties/ferry terminals projected to be prone to SLR at
the current timeline (2022) and by 2050, respectively. An additional 11 ports and
jetties/ferry terminals, the majority of which are from Sabah, is expected to be affected
by 2100. The Penang International Airport is also expected to face SLR inundation by
2050 and 2100. Assessments of dry spells indicated that five ports and jetties/ferry
terminals are vulnerable to prolonged dry spells at some particular years during midcentury, and the number is expected to reach 13 by late-century.
Public facilities such as solid waste facilities, sewerage facilities and water supply
facilities are also vulnerable to climate change. The flood areal extent maps indicated
that some waste disposal sites are prone to floods up to 2100. Floods could also affect
60 and 71 sewerage facilities at the current timeline (1971-2000) and up to 2100,
respectively. Selangor is expected to have the highest number of affected sewerage
facilities at both timelines. As for water supply facilities, 47 and 56 facilities were
projected to be flood prone at the two respectively timelines. Assessments of SLR
xxx
showed that four solid waste facilities could be affected by SLR at current timeline
(2022) and by 2050. Four additional sites are expected to be affected by 2100. The
projected numbers of sewerage facilities that could be inundated due to SLR at current
timeline, by 2050 and by 2100 were 402, 488 and 835 units, respectively. However,
SLR has no clear impact on the water supply facilities. Assessments of dry spells
indicated seven solid waste facilities are vulnerable in some particular years by earlycentury. Three additional facilities are expected to be vulnerable by mid-century and
late-century. The projected numbers of water supply facilities that could be vulnerable
to prolonged dry spells at current timeline, by 2050 and by 2100 were 11, 28 and 38
to dry spells. For flood relief centres, there could be 708 and 910 centres located in
Peninsular Malaysia vulnerable to floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000) and up to
2100, respectively.
Energy
Currently, there are 18 hydropower plants and 31 thermal power plants, each with 50
megawatts and above of capacity, in the country. Based on the flood areal extent
maps, some of the plants located in Perak, Kelantan and Selangor were projected to
be flood prone at baseline timeline and up to 2100. The operation of hydropower plants
and thermal power plants is also affected by extreme wet weather and dry spells.
Climate projection throughout the century had indicated a total of 20 hydropower
plants located in Perak, Kelantan, Pahang, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak that
could be affected by extreme wet weather. The same plants that are located in Perak,
Pahang, and Sarawak could also be affected by dry spells. For thermal power plants,
the plants located in Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Pulau Pinang and
Putrajaya are anticipated to face extreme wet weather and/or dry spell problems.
Some of these thermal power plants that are located in Selangor, Johor, Pulau Pinang
and Negeri Sembilan could also be SLR prone as well. The projected number of flood
prone substations in Peninsular Malaysia could substantially increase from 5,897
substations at baseline timeline to 7,093 substations up to 2100. Meanwhile, SLR
projection indicated that 4,137 substations are currently SLR prone. This number is
expected to increase to 4,991 and 8,003 by 2050 and 2100, respectively.
For the oil and gas industry, the number of probable flood prone PETRONAS assets
was projected to increase from 111 at baseline timeline (1971-2000) to 132 up to 2100.
SLR impact assessment had indicated 44 assets along the coastal areas of Peninsular
Malaysia that are SLR prone at current timeline (2022), and it is expected to increase
to 55 and 83 by 2050 and 2100, respectively. Future dry spell impact assessments
had indicated a total of 70 assets could be vulnerable to dry spells, in some particular
years by late-century. Extreme high temperature would lead to heat stress on
operations and the work comfortability of staff. Assets located in Gurun, Melaka,
Pengerang, Gebeng, Kerteh, Bintulu, Miri and Labuan are anticipated susceptible to
this projected extreme temperature change.
Public Health
For the public health sector, climate change impacts such as floods and SLR do pose
a significant threat to the healthcare facilities. There were 17 hospitals and 125 health
clinics projected to be flood prone at baseline timeline (1971-2000), and these
xxxi
numbers are expected to increase to 19 hospitals and 149 health clinics, respectively,
up to 2100. The impact assessments of SLR showed that four hospitals were prone to
SLR at current timeline (2022) and 2050, and four additional SLR prone hospitals are
expected to be prone by 2100. Health clinics could be more vulnerable to SLR
inundations. This is shown by the projected increments of 5 and 37 affected health
clinics by 2050 and 2100, respectively. For climate sensitive diseases such as dengue,
malaria, food and water borne diseases, leptospirosis, and heat related illness,
continuous monitoring and prevention are being carried out, as part of the prevailing
public health responses to climate change.
Gaps and Improvement Plan
The majority of the gaps identified in the NC3 have been fulfilled during the NC4
period. The flood areal extent maps for 17 river basins in Peninsular Malaysia, 10 river
basins in Sabah and 10 river basins in Sarawak, were all developed for flood impact
assessments of all sectors mentioned. For the dry spell and extreme wet weather
impact assessments, monthly and yearly rainfall indices were developed for the whole
country.
There is need for continual updating and improvement of the hydroclimate models to
enable more accurate projections. For the SLR, coastal flood inundation maps and
saltwater intrusion simulations using a two-dimensional numerical coastal
hydrodynamic model would be developed. Phenomenon arising from interaction of
SLR, storm surges, abnormally high tides and high rainfall events can be studied using
a numerical river and coastal hydrodynamic model which is important for assessments
of severe coastal flooding. Development of a comprehensive assets database hub
covering the entire country, and the specific sectoral tools and modelling, for sectoral
assessment purposes are crucial and urgent.
For capacity building, a dedicated team and facilities for developing assessment tools
and carrying out sectoral and cross-sectoral assessment exercises would have to be
engaged and established. Continuous full-scale programmes and activities to
understand the full chain of climate change implications at the state and local
governmental levels are important. As part of the plan for improvements, a
comprehensive National Adaptation Plan (NAP) that integrates elements of disaster
risk reduction from the Sendai Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals
would continue to be developed, to guide systematic implementation of no-regret
adaptation measures for all the sectors.
5. Research and Systematic Observation
Malaysia recognised the urgency and has prioritised scientific research, long-term
systematic monitoring and data collection for informed policy directions to undertake
the necessary response measures.
xxxii
Research
Over the past decade, research institutes, universities, NGOs and the private sector
had continued with their respective research activities on mitigation and adaptation
with funding primarily from national sources.
Climate modelling is carried out at the National Hydraulic Research Institute of
Malaysia (NAHRIM) and the School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences
of the National University of Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM) in
collaboration with the Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia). UKM is
leading the lower resolution Southeast Asia regional climate modelling collaboration
among ASEAN countries through the SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA programme while
NAHRIM leads the higher resolution climate modelling work for the country.
With the concentration of population into urban areas, assessment of changes in the
urban climate through city-scale climate projections modelling becomes critical in
strengthening the resilience of cities against the impacts of climate change. As a first
step towards this end, UKM’s Southeast Asia Disaster Prevention Research Initiative
(SEADPRI-UKM) and the Atmosphere Ocean Group of the Department of Applied
Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of the University of Cambridge implemented a
Disaster Resilient Cities trial project centred on Forecasting Local Level Climate
Extremes and Physical Hazards for Kuala Lumpur.
Vulnerabilities of the country’s long coastline of 8,840 km continue to gain attention as
these regions are vital economic zones and population centres. Understanding the
impacts of sea-level rise is crucial in assessing the vulnerability of the country’s vast
coastal regions. Through funding under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, the National
Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) has updated the sea-level rise
projection and these results were used for vulnerability assessments presented in
More recently, NAHRIM has also carried out an analysis of the sea surface
temperature (SST) trend around the South China Sea and adjacent region based on
the simple linear regression of the yearly averaged SST from 1982 to 2021. Most parts
of water around Peninsular Malaysia recorded a warming trend of 0.1-0.15°C/decade,
except over the southern peninsular where the warming rate is ~0.2°C/decade. The
warming rate over Sarawak coastal water is 0.1-0.15°C/decade, whilst that over the
Sabah coastal areas is slightly higher at 0.15-0.20°C/decade.
Under the 11th Malaysia Plan, NAHRIM has undertaken several studies through finescale modelling to produce projections of the impacts of climate change on the
hydrological regime and water resources of Malaysia. Two primary studies had been
completed namely the extension study of the Impact of Climate Change on the
Hydrologic Regime and Water Resources of Malaysia (Phase 2) and the Impact of
Climate Change on the Hydro-Climate of Malaysia based on IPCC AR5 for Peninsular
Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. A third study focusing on drought was completed in
2022.
xxxiii
Research in the agriculture sector focuses on the vulnerabilities of key crops to the
changing rainfall patterns, temperature rise and floodings. Studies were carried out to
discover drought- and flood-tolerant traits of rice, rubber and cocoa.
Various studies were conducted on rice varieties that can be grown under drought
conditions such as supplemental irrigation instead of the conventional maximum
standing water in the field. Results showed that saturated water conditions did not
cause significant reduction of the plant physiological performance. A local specialty
rice variety had shown drought-tolerant traits that can be introduced to non-granary
areas that are water stressed and the findings will be tested further through pilot scale
studies under the 12th Malaysia Plan.
In the livestock sub-sector, research efforts were focusing on the development of
country-specific enteric fermentation emission factor for the various cattle breed.
A long-term Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) study involved assessment
of the impacts of elevated CO2 on the productivity of lowland forest under Sustainable
Forest Management practices is being carried out for the development of a potential
adaptation measure for the forestry sector. Research in tropical peatland carried out
by the Sarawak Tropical Peat Research Institute involved the use of chamber based
(manual and automated chambers) and eddy covariance methods to measure GHGs
fluxes.
Evidence from local research on climate change impacts to human health has
increased considerably over the past few years as the Ministry of Health’s bio-medical
research wing, the Institute of Medical Research (IMR) has kept up with research on
climate-related health threats. Health Research priorities under the 12th Malaysia Plan
(2021–2025) has outlined two focus areas: climate change and climate-sensitive
diseases; and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment including during
extreme weather events. Research has focused on vector-borne, food and waterborne, Leptospirosis and non-communicable respiratory diseases as well as heatrelated illnesses.
In the energy sector, the key research entities such as TNB Research (TNBR) and
SIRIM has made some significant achievements in the deployment of renewable
energy technologies particularly in the field of solar and biogas energy. SIRIM has
developed a 200 MMBtu/day bio-compressed natural gas production plant in Tawau,
Sabah to demonstrate the feasibility of utilisation of Compressed Bio-gas (CBG) from
palm oil mill effluent for land transport and industry usage. Palm oil millers in Sabah
have started to use compressed bio-methane gas in their trucks. Meanwhile, TNBR
has developed a non-thermal plasma (NTP) system to reform biogas, adding value to
its utilisation. Since NC3, TNBR has also continued its experiment and research on
carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies at existing power plants. Two
projects at the CCU Research Station in TNB Janamanjung power plant have yielded
strong potential for adoption and scaling-up.
Systematic Observation
Systematic observation of climate change and assessment of its impacts are
conducted by several frontline technical governmental agencies and departments.
xxxiv
Meteorological parameters are monitored by two key agencies, the METMalaysia
which gathers meteorological data from its nationwide network of weather stations
while the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) collects rainfall data and monitor
water level of river basins for its hydrological observation.
Other agencies such as the Slope Engineering Division of Public Work Department
(PWD) and Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan (PLUS), the concessionaire of the northsouth axis highway of Peninsular Malaysia also carried out rainfall observations at hilly
region and along the tolled highways respectively. Sea level rise is monitored by the
Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM) which operates 21 tide gauge
stations. With the recorded tidal data, JUPEM is able to obtain sea level rise trend
through time series analysis from the date of establishment of the tide gauge station.
Monitoring in the biodiversity and natural ecosystem are reported through the national
reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Forest Resources
Assessment of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation which focuses
on the baseline status and trends. The assessments contained in these reports have
indirect information on climate change impacts.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has implemented a number of programmes and
activities to monitor certain communicable and environmental diseases that are
directly or indirectly related to climate change. To improve population health in a
changing climate, the resilient healthcare system includes a climate-sensitive disease
surveillance system as well as capacity building of health personnel to enhance their
response and readiness capabilities to the health impacts of climate change.
Air quality is monitored by the Department of Environment (DOE) of the federal
ministry and the Natural Resources and Environment Board (NREB) under the
Sarawak Government via 65 automatic and 14 manual stations installed throughout
the country.
6. Capacity-building, Education, Public Awareness, Information-sharing and
Networking
Interest and attention on climate change continue to grow within the government,
research institutions, private sector, civil society organisations and general public
since NC3.
At the policy-making level, the government has enhanced its focus on addressing
climate change as illustrated through continuous mainstreaming of mitigation and
adaptation elements into the relevant development policies. The financial and capital
sector over the past few years has taken a keen interest on climate change and had
carried out a series of awareness programme among its members from regulatory
body to private banks and institutional investors.
Civil society organisations with their varied and specific expertise continue to play an
active role in increasing the overall awareness and responses of Malaysia in facing
the climate change phenomena. Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and
the spate of climate-related disasters around the world, local media interests were
heightened on the importance of international cooperation to address climate change.
xxxv
Capacity Building
Malaysia continues to build its institutional capacity in applying the IPCC 2006
Guidelines in the preparation of its GHG Inventory, enabled by regional and local
trainings especially in the energy, IPPU, AFOLU and waste sectors. These efforts
were made possible through the UNFCCC’s workshops and the annual Workshop on
Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Asia (WGIA), an initiative of Japan via its National
Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES).
TNBR conducted training with the aim to develop the CO 2 and non-CO2 emission
factors by flue gas for the electricity sub-sector while personnel from the Malaysian
Agriculture Research and Development Institute (MARDI) were trained on the
procedures for higher tier estimation of GHG emissions from livestock.
Key agencies implementing mitigation-related efforts are building on their existing
training programmes to enhance the capacity of their personnel to ensure the
continuity and successful outcomes of those efforts.
In the promotion of renewable energy, the Sustainable Energy Development Authority
(SEDA) and TNBR had continued with their respective human capital development
training programmes in the area of both grid-connected and off-grid photovoltaic
system design, installation and maintenance courses. SEDA has also engaged the
Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association in terms of regulatory knowledge, policy
direction, technology development and business outlook.
In support of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2016-2025), courses on
energy audits and energy management continue to be conducted by both SEDA and
TNBR. In the last four years since NC3, these courses had trained hundreds of energy
managers and professionals in measurement and verification from more than a
hundred organisations.
Meanwhile, in the construction industry, the Construction Industry Development Board
(CIDB) has also continued to produce certified facilitators and assessors through its
Malaysian Carbon Reduction and Environmental Sustainability Tool (MyCREST)
programme. This programme helps in the design, construction and operation of energy
efficient buildings.
For the forestry sector, capacity and awareness of various stakeholders for the
implementation of the National REDD plus Strategy were enhanced particularly at the
sub-national level with technical support from national agency. In addition, Sabah
Forestry Department also conducted capacity-building activities to implement its
REDD plus strategy. Forestry departments have enhanced their preparedness for
climate impacts by incorporating forest fire management into their respective forest
management protocols.
In the area of vulnerability assessment and adapting to climate change, the NAHRIM
has carried out several capacity building programmes in regional climate change
modelling for Malaysia as well as vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessment for
the targeted groups of relevant stakeholders. Specific capacity building programmes
to strengthen the expertise of officers in assessment of climate vulnerabilities included
xxxvi
the areas of water resources, sea level rise, sea surface temperature and saltwater
intrusion. For the water sector, NAHRIM has produced the Climate Change Adaptation
Framework which provides strategic planning options to address adverse impacts of
climate change and increase sectoral resilience. It has also embarked on V&A training
through the development of Malaysia Adaptation Index (MAIN), which summarises the
level of vulnerability and readiness of each state in facing the impacts of climate
change.
Workshops and training to strengthen linkages between disaster risk reduction and
climate change was led by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Southeast Asia Disaster
Prevention Initiative (SEADPRI-UKM) in collaboration with multiple partners under the
aegis of the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) Malaysia.
In anticipation of adverse climate impacts on food production, agriculture researchers
and officers participated in various training programmes to equip themselves with
available tools, skills and knowledge. Researchers were exposed to various climate
resilience technologies and practices through capacity-building programmes by
international bodies for ASEAN member states. MARDI is also spearheading rice
genetic research and cooperation with other rice-producing ASEAN members as a
climate resilience solution for this staple food.
Attention is also being paid to developing resilience of vital infrastructures such as in
the oil and gas fields, electricity generation assets and public health facilities.
Education
Climate change education saw increased interests within the public sector in the past
few years. Public agencies on the frontline of climate impacts are equipping their
personnels with climate change knowledge and incorporating mitigation and
adaptation elements in their programmes and plans.
Meanwhile, dissemination of information and knowledge on climate change continues
in both formal and informal environmental education through the schools’ and higher
education institutions’ curriculum and extra-curriculum activities. The Ministry of
Education has incorporated climate change in the geography syllabus of secondary
schools as well as in language and science subjects. To enhance the research
capacity and output of academicians, the Academy of Science Malaysia (ASM) held
seminars and workshops centred on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and played a
role in linking local scientists’ engagement with the IPCC’s process.
State-owned enterprises and major conglomerates are acutely aware that they need
to beef up awareness internally and lead by example by holding regular lectures and
trainings to sensitise their respective personnel. The corporate sector has also
stepped up its informal environmental education in tandem with the increase in
Corporate Social Responsibilities programmes among the private sector.
Public Awareness
Awareness on climate change among general public is best strengthened by direct
participation of the targeted communities. Towards this end, there is a marked
xxxvii
increase of awareness programmes involving direct participation in the area of
forestry, energy, waste and sea level rise. Civil society organisations in Malaysia also
played their parts in raising awareness of climate change via their respective
programmes with recurring annual events or long-standing engagement with local
communities.
In terms of climate-related disaster preparedness and development of early warning
system, the DID provides information on floods, rainfall, river water level and
associated flood risks, flood cameras, drought by river flow and drought by dam to the
public through a web portal. For communities at the frontline of vulnerable
infrastructure such as dams, TNBR has embarked on a programme to sensitise local
communities including indigenous villagers living close to hydro power stations
operated by its parent company TNB. The programme includes evacuation drills
involving hundreds of residents and villagers.
In more recent time, the financial and capital market sector has embarked on a series
of awareness raising campaign to educate bankers, institutional investors and insurers
on the importance of adopting sustainability in their operation and greening their
investments portfolios. In its series of Thematic Sustainability Workshop, Bursa
Malaysia Berhad (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) has raised
awareness on exposure to climate risks and the role of the financial sector towards
the transition to a low carbon economy.
Information-sharing and Networking
Collaboration to address the challenges of climate change has continued at the
international and regional level. Malaysia’s networking in climate actions cover the
areas of energy, industrial processes, agriculture, low carbon cities.
At the UNFCCC, UNDP and GCF level, Malaysian’s policy-makers were able to build
their capacities in key areas of climate actions such as climate finance, adaptation,
REDD plus implementation, development of nationally-determined contributions and
enhanced transparency framework. The latter two areas are vital aspects towards
implementation of the Paris Agreement which gained momentum after it came into
force in November, 2016.
At the ASEAN level, the country has been in active collaboration with the ASEAN
Centre for Energy in the area of energy management. Malaysian companies were
keen supporters of the ASEAN Energy Awards (AEA) initiative that was launched in
2000 to promote awareness on best practices in energy efficiency and conservation
in buildings, industries and energy management, renewable energy, and clean coal
technology.
7. Constraints, Gaps, Level of Support Received and Needs
Malaysia has utilised domestic resources as well as financial, technical and capacity
building support from international sources to implement climate actions. Both
multilateral and bilateral resources were received by federal and state agencies.
xxxviii
Constraints and Gaps
Challenges remained in implementing the country’s commitment to address climate
change and its impacts. Some of the challenges had been identified by the Team of
Technical Experts (TTE) during the International Consultation and Analysis of
Malaysia’s Third BUR. These challenges include the development of country-specific
emission factors, improvement of activity data collection, long term modelling tools for
emission projection and enhancing the national capacity to conduct the technology
needs assessment. More importantly is the availability of the right type of technology
for mitigation and adaptation implementation and the availability of funding for the
implementation.
Level of Support Received
The main source of international financial support is through the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF), one of the two operating entities of the UNFCCC’s financial mechanism
from cycle 1 to 7 (June 1994 to June 2022), The funding provided by GEF, other
multilateral agencies and bilateral sources were channeled through specific projects.
Financial support through GEF-6 and GEF-7 cycles were primarily used to build up
technical and technological capacities in transport, energy, forestry (including
peatland), low carbon cities and community empowerment projects.
The amount of funding provided by GEF for NC4 is USD500,000. It should be noted
that in the preparation of BUR4 which was submitted to the UNFCCC on 31 December
2022, the allocation of USD352,000 from GEF for BUR3 was used. This was made
possible as the balance from BUR2’s allocation was used to prepare BUR3 which was
submitted on 31 December 2020.
The other UNFCCC’s financial mechanism operating entities, the Green Climate Fund
(GCF) has provided readiness support for Malaysia to enhance its implementation
framework to access results-based payment for the forestry sector. Malaysia is also in
the process of applying for financial support to develop a comprehensive National
Adaptation Plan.
Besides financial support, Malaysia has participated in a wide range of capacity
building programmes in the areas of GHG inventory, mitigation (measurement,
reporting and verifying emissions data), adaptation planning, implementing and
enhancing NDCs, climate negotiations, climate finance and Article 6 and 13 of the
Paris Agreement provided by various multilateral organisations, Annex I and nonAnnex I Parties to the UNFCCC.
At the sub-national level, the states of Johor and Melaka have received capacitybuilding from the United Kingdom Prosperity Fund’s Future Cities Programme and the
Japanese Joint Crediting Mechanism’s City to City Collaboration for Building Energy
Monitoring and Reporting System.
xxxix
Needs
Malaysia is only beginning to report on its achievement of its NDCs and additional
technical capacity-building and financial assistance would be needed to develop
systems to track NDCs implementation and cooperative approaches (Article 6 of the
Paris Agreement).
An estimated amount of USD2.25mil in international funding is required for GHG
inventory improvement. To implement the identified mitigation actions, major financial
support is required by the iron and steel industry to the tune of USD47mil. For
adaptation, a preliminary estimate of USD63.6mil is required for various initiatives to
enhance resilience measures throughout the country.

1. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1.1
Introduction
This chapter provides information on Malaysia’s national circumstances up to the year
2019 where relevant geography, natural resources, social and economic published
statistics are available. It also communicates the status of key climate-related sectors
and their respective policies and strategic measures.
1.2
Geography: Location and Topography
Malaysia lies between 0º 51’ N and 7º 33’ N, and 98º 01’ E and 119º 30’ E and is
located in the Southeast Asia region. It has a land area of 330,241 km 2 with about
4,809 km of coastline and over 879 islands. It consists of thirteen states and three
Federal Territories. Eleven of the states and two of the Federal Territories (Kuala
Lumpur and Putrajaya) are located in Peninsular Malaysia (Figure 1.1). The states of
Sabah and Sarawak are located on the Borneo Island and are separated from
Peninsular Malaysia by the South China Sea. The Federal Territory of Labuan with an
area of 92 km2 and with 81.5 km coastline is located off the coast of western Sabah.
The topography of Peninsular Malaysia ranges from coastal plains to mountainous
terrains. It has a land area of approximately 132,078 km 2 and a coast length of about
3,771.5/1,972 km. Its north-south extent is about 746 km and its maximum east-west
width is about 315 km. It is also divided into the east and west coasts by the central
mountainous region known as the Titiwangsa Range which extends from north to
south for about 617 km in length with the highest point reaching 2,183 m above sea
level. It is also the headwater of the Pahang River, which at 482 km is the longest river
in Peninsular Malaysia and the third longest river in Malaysia.
Sabah which lies on the north-eastern part of Borneo Island has a land area of
approximately 73,621 km2. Its coastline runs the length of approximately 1,035 km.
Sabah’s topography is primarily mountainous, especially in the western flank with
undulating lowland basins in the eastern part. The Crocker Range divides the western
coastal plains from the hinterland of Sabah. At 4,095 m above sea level, Low’s Peak
on the Kinabalu plateau of the Crocker Range is the highest point in Malaysia. The
Kinabatangan River is the longest river in Sabah at 568 km and is the second longest
in Malaysia.
Sarawak has a land area of approximately 124,450 km 2 and lies on the north central
and western part of Borneo Island. Sarawak’s coastline is about 1,802 km. Its
topography features coastal plains followed by a narrow belt of hills before sharply
rising into a mountainous region towards the Kalimantan border with Indonesia. Mount
Murud at 2,422 m is the highest mountain in Sarawak. The second highest peak Mount
Mulu (2,377 m) has the largest natural limestone cave system in the world. The Rajang
River at 780 km is the longest river in Sarawak as well as in Malaysia.
1.3
Governance and Climate Change
Malaysia is a federation consisting of 13 states and 3 federal territories. The Head of
State is the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong (also known as the King), and is elected among
the nine monarchical states for a five-year term. The head of states for the states of
Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Johor, Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan their respective
sultans, while the head of states of Negeri Sembilan and Perlis are the Yang DiPertuan Besar and Raja respectively. The head of states of the other four states,
namely Pulau Pinang, Melaka, Sarawak and Sabah are called Yang Di-Pertuan Negeri
or sometimes referred to as Governor. They are elected by Yang Di-Pertuan Agong
for a renewable four-year term, on the advice of the Prime Minister and in consultation
with the states government.
Its legislative power is divided between its federal and state legislatures. The
Malaysian Parliament consist of the Dewan Negara (Senate) with 70 members and
the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) with 222 members. Out of the 70
senators in the Senate, 44 are appointed by His Majesty Yang Di-Pertuan Agong while
26 are elected by the State legislatures. The 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat are
elected in a general election, due every 5 years. The Prime Minister is the Head of
Government and must be a member of the House of Representative that have the
support of the majority of the members of House of Representative.
At the state level, the state legislative assemblies are also elected in every five years.
The head of government for each of the nine monarchical states is the Menteri Besar,
and the four remaining states is the Chief Minister.
The federal legislature and the executive arm of the government have the
responsibility for developing and implementing policies and drafting national laws to
enable the country to fulfil its international obligations in addressing climate change.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES) is the
focal ministry for climate change. Nevertheless, the respective states have jurisdiction
over the management of natural resources, especially land, forest and water.
1.4
Climate
1.4.1 Annual Temperature Trends for Malaysia
Malaysia has an equatorial climate with a uniform daily variation of temperatures
throughout the year. The daily mean temperature lies between 26 ⁰C and 28 ⁰C. In the
past 50 years, there has been a positive trend in temperature increase. Figure 1.2
shows the annual trends of temperature for Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah
from 1969 to 2019 respectively. The surface mean temperature increased by 0.13 ⁰C
to 0.24 ⁰C per decade. The surface maximum temperature increased by 0.17 ⁰C to
0.23 ⁰C per decade while minimum temperature increased by 0.19 ⁰C to 0.30 ⁰C per
decade.

The highest daily maximum and lowest daily minimum temperatures for each year
from 1951 to 2019 according to data collected from 19 meteorological stations across
Malaysia are shown below in Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4. The highest daily maximum
temperature shows an increasing trend with the highest daily maximum temperature
over in Peninsular Malaysia, followed by Sarawak and Sabah. However, the lowest
daily maximum shows a different trend. Sarawak records an increasing linear trend
while Peninsular and Sabah records nearly zero linear trend.

The winds over the country are generally light and variable. However, there are some
uniform changes in the wind flow patterns characterised by two monsoons which are
separated by two shorter inter-monsoon periods. North-eastern winds are strong
during the boreal winter monsoon which usually occurs from November to March. The
boreal summer monsoon occurs between May to September with south-westerly
winds prevailing during this period. During inter-monsoonal periods, occurrence of
heavy rain and thunderstorms in the late afternoons and evenings are relatively
common.
1.4.2 Annual Rainfall Distribution
Rainfall distribution in Malaysia is influenced by topography and monsoon winds. As
a result, Malaysia has abundant annual rainfall that averages about 2,000 mm to 4,000
mm. During the northeast monsoon, the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, northeast
of Sabah and southern Sarawak can sometimes experience spells of heavy rain
lasting about three days, which can cause severe floods. In contrast, the southwest
monsoon is drier with lower rainfall. During the inter-monsoon periods, heavy rain from
convective showers and thunderstorms occurs in the late afternoons and
evenings. Figure 1.5 shows the annual rainfall for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and
Sarawak from 1951 to 2019. For this period, there is very slight increasing trend in the
rainfall for Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak whereas a slight decreasing trend in
Sabah. The drier years are mainly because of strong El Niño and the Indian Ocean
Dipole events.

Sea Level Rise
Malaysia’s coastal areas lie within four seas, namely the Straits of Malacca, the South
China Sea the Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea. Changes in sea level in these seas would
affect the coastal landmass of the country. Sea level rise and its trend is being
monitored through 21 tide gauge stations since 1981 by the Department of Survey and
Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM). Table 1.1 shows the trend across 11 stations in
Peninsular Malaysia and Table 1.2 shows the trend across 8 stations in Sabah,
Sarawak and the Federal Territories of Labuan. Data from two new stations installed
in 2020, namely at Tanjung Pengelih (Peninsular Malaysia) and Santubong (Sarawak)
would be made available after the first five-year observation period. Between 1986
and 2021, the average annual sea level rise for Peninsular Malaysia was 3.2 mm per
annum. For Sabah and Sarawak and the Federal Territories of Labuan, sea level rise
was 2.9 mm per annum from 1988 to 2021.

Forest and Biodiversity
1.6.1 Forests
Malaysia’s forests are comprised of complex ecosystems and are home to a wide
range of species. Malaysia has consistently maintained more than 50% of its landmass
as forest following its voluntary pledge at the Earth Summit in 1992. This includes
Permanent Reserved Forests (PRFs), state land forests (SLF) and Totally Protected
Areas (TPA/PA). In 2019, 18.14 million ha, or approximately 54.9% of the total land
area of Malaysia was under forest cover. The remaining land area comprised of
agricultural and commodity crops, settlements, wetlands and grasslands. Table 1.3
below presents a breakdown of the total forested areas in Malaysia according to the
three regions.

Malaysia’s terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated within tropical rainforests that extend
from coastal plains to mountainous areas, including wetlands, such as lakes and
rivers. Marine biodiversity is primarily located among islands and coastal ecosystems,
especially in mangrove/tidal mudflats, coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Agricultural
biodiversity is conserved in plantations, rice fields, fruit orchards, and farms. Table 1.4

Water Resources
Malaysia relies on rainfall as its main water source that feeds its 2,986 river basins of
which 189 are major ones and to recharge its groundwater reservoirs. The country
receives about 973 billion cm3 of water from rainfall annually according to the National
Water Resources Study (2000-2050) report. From this, the total surface runoff is
estimated to be 496 billion cm3 per year. On a yearly basis, about 414 billion cm3 return
to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration process and 63 billion cm 3 as
groundwater recharge.
Rainfall is unevenly distributed with some states receiving more rain than others. High
intensity and prolonged periods of rainfall results in flooding in low-lying and coastal
areas where rivers are short and catchment areas are small. Certain regions with
smaller water catchments are likely to be more susceptible to water stress in the future.
The National Water Resources Policy launched in 2012 under the 10 th Malaysia Plan
outlined clear directions and strategies for water resources management, including
collaborative governance to ensure water security and sustainability. The 11 th
Malaysia Plan continued the policy direction and emphasised that stronger protection
and conservation of water resources needs to be carried out. Alternative water supply
initiatives such as rainwater harvesting, tube wells and gravity feed systems are being
implemented as supplementary sources to serve remote areas.
1.9
National Physical Planning
For the period until 2020, national physical development in Peninsular Malaysia is
guided by three physical planning documents, the National Physical Plan-3 (NPP-3),
the Second National Urbanisation Policy (NUP-2) and the National Rural Physical Plan
2030 (NRPP 2030). Due to constitutional arrangements, the states of Sabah and
Sarawak have autonomy in the development control process and are governed by
separate planning systems. Thus, NPP-3, NUP-2 and NRPP 2030 only applies to
Peninsular Malaysia.
The NPP-3 is the highest-ranking planning document in the national development
framework which translates strategic and sectoral policies into spatial and physical
dimensions. Emphasis is placed on sustainability and resilience towards climate
change in three strategic directions:
a) Sustainable management of natural, food and heritage resources;
b) Holistic land use planning; and
c) Low carbon cities and sustainable infrastructure.
The three strategic directions are being implemented through 15 strategies and 44
actions. The 15 strategies are:
a) Improving preservation and conservation of national ecological assets;
b) Managing and controlling development in environmentally sensitive areas;
c) Enhancing security and sustainability of water resources;
d) Managing mineral resource exploration;
e) Promoting food security;
f) Strengthening protection and preservation of national archaeological and
natural heritage sites;
g) Optimising land use and availability;
h) Managing natural disaster risk areas;
i) Managing development growth and sprawl;
j) Promoting integrated rural development;
k) Creating low carbon cities development;
l) Promoting use of sustainable energy sources;
m) Implementing integrated water cycle management;
n) Promoting green mobility; and
o) Strengthening integrated and sustainable solid waste management.
The NUP-2 provides guidance on sustainable urban planning and development with
an emphasis for balanced development physically, environmentally, socially and
economically. The NRPP 2030 is the first spatial rural development document that
outlines policy statements, strategies and implementation measures towards
materialising the rural development vision.

Health and wellbeing of the people are an essential part of an improved standard of
living that Malaysia strives to achieve. In the mid-term review of the 11th Malaysia Plan
(2016-2020), the Malaysian government set the goal of creating a sustainable
healthcare system and the first step it took in that direction was with the introduction
of the Malaysia National Health Policy (MNHP). This policy focuses on population
health as well as the sustainability of the healthcare system.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the main provider of healthcare services. An extensive
network of primary healthcare services is delivered by Government health facilities
together with private medical and dental clinics. This network is supported by
secondary and tertiary services provided by both the Government and private sector.

1.12.1 Policies
The energy sector is anticipated to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and
sustainable energy, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 7 of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. The National Energy Policy 2022 – 2040, introduced in
September 2022 underscores the commitment towards energy transformation with a
focus to shift from fossil-based systems of production and consumption to renewable
energy. The policy aligns the energy sector to the country’s long-term plan of Shared
Prosperity Vision 2030 and its five Key Economic Growth Activities which are directly
related to the energy sector (such as sustainable mobility, renewable energy and
green economy). The policy aims to spur new energy-related sectors which will also
support the goal of reducing dependence on petroleum-based revenue and commodity
trade, enhancing the resilience of the country’s fiscal and economic position in the
process. The policy also sets the directive towards Low Carbon Nation Aspiration 2040
from the improvement of primary energy mix intensity through increased penetration
of clean and renewable sources of energy. This is in line with the Government’s target
to reach 31% of RE installed capacity mix by 2025.
1.12.2 Energy Balance
Malaysia’s primary energy supply in 2019 was 98,680 ktoe with oil and gas as the
main source of primary energy supplies. However, renewable energy contribution
shows an increasing trend. Figure 1.7 shows a summary of Malaysia’s primary energy
supply in 2019 and Table 1.13 shows the breakdown in selected years from 2005 to

Transport
The Land Public Transport Agency (APAD) replaced the Land Public Transport
Commission (SPAD) in June 2018, taking over its function of developing Malaysia’s
land public transport system including the mass rail transit (MRT), light rail transit
(LRT), rail transportation and bus systems. The Agency is tasked with ‘spearheading
the transformation of an integrated, efficient and safe transportation system’. A
National Transport Policy (2019-2030) was launched to increase the public transport
modal share (40% by 2030) in urban areas while also implementing sustainable
measures across all transport modes.
1.13.1 Roads
The length of roads has increased substantially from 90,016 km in 2005 to 258,511
km in 2019.This is primarily due to extensive expansion of state roads in the past
decade leading to greater intra-state and interstate accessibility. Table 1.18 highlights
the historical changes in lengths of roads.

1.13.3 Urban Rail Transit
The rail network is crucial to the Malaysia’s transport system as it enables greater
domestic mobility. By the end of 2016, there were five urban rail network lines serving
the Greater Kuala Lumpur namely KTM Komuter, LRT Ampang Line, LRT Kelana Jaya
Line, KL Monorail and the MRT. The total ridership of rail transit and commuter trains
is shown in Table 1.20.
The KTM Komuter service was first introduced in 1995 and was intended to serve
interstate and within Greater Kuala Lumpur’s radial corridors. Both the LRT Ampang
Line (27 km) and the LRT Kelana Jaya Line (29 km) commenced operations in the city
on 16 December 1996 and on 1 September 1998 respectively. The 8.6 km KL Monorail
was built over an elevated track and commenced operations on 31 August 2003. In
2002, the KLIA Ekspres and the KLIA Transit were launched. The KLIA Ekspres is a
high-speed, non-stop rail connection between KLIA, KLIA2 and the KL Sentral,
providing a mass rail transportation option in support of the civil aviation industry. On
the other hand, the KLIA Transit is a commuter service that stops at three intermediate
stations. To accommodate the highly populated areas, both LRT lines – Ampang and
Kelana Jaya – were extended to 45 km in total length for LRT Ampang and 46 km for
LRT Kelana Jaya. The extended length went into operation on 30 June 2016.
The first MRT line – the 46 km Kajang Line - commenced service in July 2017. Phase
One of the 57.7 km second line (Putrajaya Line) began operation on 16 June 2022.
Phase Two of the Putrajaya Line is due for completion in the first quarter of 2023.

Agriculture
In 2011, policies on food production and agro-commodities were separated and
developed under two distinct policy documents, namely the National Agrofood Policy
(2011-2020) and the National Commodity Policy (2011-2020). For the post 2020
period, agriculture development is being guided by the National Agrofood Policy 20212030 and the National Agri-Commodity Policy 2021-2030. Sustainable development
is a key principle in both policies besides strengthening the two subsectors’
contributions to food security and socio-economic development.
1.14.1 Agricultural Crops
The agriculture area consists of primarily commodity crops such as oil palm, rubber
and cocoa. Paddy is also an important agricultural crop and the planted areas involved
double cropping. Table 1.25 reflects the changes in planted areas of major agricultural
crops in selected years between 2005 and 2019.

Institutional Arrangements
The institutional arrangements support three key areas of climate change action:
policy making, development planning and implementation, and guidance and
reporting. It should be highlighted that since the Third National Communication (NC3),
Malaysia had experienced three rounds of changes in Government and ministerial
restructuring. Changes during the first two rounds were reported in the Third Biennial
Update Report (submitted December 2020) and the latest round being the most recent
change in federal power which is detailed below.
1.17.1 Restructuring of Ministries in 2022
Following the results of the 15th General Election in November 2022, the two key
ministries for climate change were merged. The Ministry of Environment and Water,
which was the focal point ministry to the UNFCCC since 2020 and the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources were combined to form the Ministry of Natural
Resources, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC). Subsequently, as of the end
of December 2023, it underwent further transformation into the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES). This ministry now takes on the
role of the national focal point for climate change within the UNFCCC framework.
In addition, several ministries and the central planning agency had undergone
restructuring and/or renaming as listed below:
(a) Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries to Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security;
(b) Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs to Ministry of Domestic Trade
and Cost of Living;
(c) Ministry of Housing and Local Government to Ministry of Local Government
Development;
(d) Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities to Ministry of Plantation and
Commodities; and
(e) Economic Planning Unit, Prime Minister’s Department to Ministry of Economy.
1.17.2 Policy Making
The Malaysia Climate Change Action Council (MyCAC) was established to address
the policy direction of climate change in December 2020. It is chaired by the Prime
Minister and has key Cabinet Ministers and state leaders as members.
The Cabinet is the highest policy decision-making body in the country on climate
change matters under the purview of the Minister of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sustainability (NRES). Any decisions taken at the MyCAC and other
bodies require a final endorsement by the Cabinet.
1.17.3 Development Planning and Implementation
Development planning and implementation is coordinated by the Ministry of Economy
in consultation with other Ministries. These are carried out through the five-year
development plans and include climate change mitigation and adaptation
programmes. Table 1.33 shows the coordinating Ministries and their respective
implementing agencies for key sectors.

1.17.4 Guidance and Reporting
The National Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC)
Operational matters on climate change are guided and endorsed by the National
Steering Committee on Climate Change (NSCCC) chaired by the Secretary General
of NRES. The coordination for the preparation of national communications (NCs) and
biennial update reports (BURs) is under the Technical Committee on Climate Change
(TCCC) which reports to the NSCCC.
The secretariat to these committees is the Climate Change Division of NRES which is
also the national focal point for climate change to the UNFCCC. The technical work of
the NCs and BURs is carried out through six Technical Working Groups (TWGs)
established under the TCCC. Figure 1.10 shows the institutional arrangement and
thematic groupings to address climate change and NC/BUR reporting.
Groups for Climate Change
The National Steering Committee and Technical Working Committee for REDD
Plus
At the national level, the National Steering Committee on REDD Plus (NSCREDD)
was established in 2011 to formulate the directions and strategies for REDD plus
implementation. The NSCREDD is chaired by the Secretary General of the NRES with
membership from State Economic Planning Units, Forestry Departments and relevant
Ministries. NSCREDD is supported by the Technical Working Committee on REDD
Plus. The roles of this Technical Working Committee include providing methodological
guidance on REDD plus implementation and formulating national action plans.
The National Committee on Clean Development Mechanism
The National Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Committee was established in
2002 to guide CDM implementation. It is chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General of
the NRES with the Secretary General being the Designated National Authority (DNA).
2. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY
2.1
Introduction
This chapter provides a summary analysis of the GHG Inventory of Malaysia for 2019.
Estimations were carried out for four sectors, namely the energy, industrial processes
and product used (IPPU), agriculture forestry and other land use (AFOLU), and waste
sectors. In the analysis, the AFOLU sector would be presented as AFOLU-Agriculture
(IPCC category 3A and 3C) and AFOLU-LULUCF (IPCC category 3B and 3D).
Detailed information on the national GHG inventory for 2019 and time series from
1990-2019 had been reported in Malaysia’s Fourth Biennial Update Report.
2.2
Institutional Arrangement
The institutional structure for the preparation of the national GHG inventory is shown
in Figure 1.10 of chapter 1 (National Circumstances). The GHG inventory preparation
is coordinated by the Climate Change Division under the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environmental Sustainability (NRES). The preparation of the inventory is steered
by a GHG Inventory Technical Working Group (TWG) supported by five thematic Sub
Working Groups (SWG), namely for the Energy, IPPU, Agriculture, Land Use, Landuse Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Waste sectors. The TWG on GHG Inventory
meets regularly to provide methodological guidance to ensure transparency, accuracy,
completeness, consistency and comparability of the GHG inventory work carried out
by the five sectoral SWGs.
2.3
Methodology for GHG Emissions Calculation
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and 2013
Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories:
Wetlands, were used to estimate the GHG emissions and removals. Emission
estimates were calculated for both reference and sectoral approaches for the energy
sector. Time series were recalculated to reflect the updated methodologies, activity
data, emission factors in accordance with these guidelines.
The estimated methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)
emissions were converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq.) using the 100-year
time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values reported in the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4).
Comparison was also carried out to assess the differences in CO2 eq. GHG emissions
between using IPCC AR4 and AR5 100-year time horizon GWPs.
2.4
Improvements in Current GHG Inventory
Effort had been taken to compile a more complete and accurate 2019 GHG inventory
than those GHG inventories reported in earlier National Communications and Biennial
Update Reports. Table 2.1 shows the sub-categories included in the 2019 GHG
inventory compared to the earlier inventory reported in NC3.

Note:
NA (not applicable) – activities in a given source/sink category which do not result in

NE (not estimated) – existing emissions and removals which have not been estimated;
NO (not occurring) – activities or processes that do not occur for a particular gas or
source/sink category within a country.
Efforts had also been taken to improve the accuracy and completeness of the whole
GHG inventory time series.
For the energy sector sectoral approach estimations, recalculations were undertaken
for the road transport and fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas sub-categories.
In the National Energy Balance (NEB), information on gasoline and diesel usage was
only available for the whole transport sector and past disaggregation of that data for
road transport GHG emission estimation was based on expert judgement. In the
current inventory, road transport GHG emission estimation was based on petrol
(gasoline) and diesel sold at petrol stations nationwide where the data from 2017-2019
was made available by the ministry responsible for domestic trade. For the inventory
years prior to 2017, the estimation was based on a ratio method based on the 20172019 petrol and diesel usage for road transport to total petrol and diesel usage for the
transport sector reported in the NEB.
Recalculation for fugitive emissions from oil and gas was carried out based on the total
amount of gas vented and flared from the oil and gas fields from 2012-2019 that was
made available to the compilers by the Malaysia Petroleum Management. For the
years prior to 2012, the activity data for amount of gas flared or vented was estimated
based on the product of ratio of gas production in the year concerned and the average
of the gas production from 2012-2014 and the amount vented or flared in the gas and
oil fields. For all the other sub-categories under fugitive emission from oil and natural
gas systems (apart from venting and flaring during production), the emission factor at
the lower 10% of the default emission factor range of the developing countries in the
2006 IPCC Guidelines was used. This value was chosen based on discussion and
information with PETRONAS that the fugitive emissions from their operations would
be comparable to those of developed countries.
For the IPPU sector, emissions from ferroalloys production were estimated for 20172019 for the first time. Minor recalculations were also undertaken for ‘other process
uses of carbonates’ from 2011-2016 to remove double counting and incorrect
interpretation of the activity data for 2016.
For the agriculture sector a minor update was undertaken to take into account updates
in animal population and correction of errors in reporting the GHG emission time series
totals in the Technical Annex of BUR3.
For the LULUCF sector, recalculation was undertaken for forest land. This was due to
improvement in the tracking of land-use change in the years 1994-1996 and 20152016, taking into account the 20 years period in land use transition. Recalculation for
cropland category was also undertaken, where the total harvest for oil palm, rubber
and cocoa had been updated, besides updating the total cultivated area for years
2011, 2012 and 2014 for cocoa.
For the waste sector, a minor update was undertaken for ‘solid waste disposal’ to
correct the truncated value of 1.33 for CH4/C that was used in the calculation in BUR3.
The recycling rate was also updated for 2014-2016. For domestic wastewater
treatment and discharge, an update was also undertaken for the time series to reflect
the additional activity data made available by the sewerage services departments in
the state of Sarawak and Sabah respectively.
2.5
Summary of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals for 2019
This section provides a summary of the greenhouse gas emissions and removals for
2019.
2.5.1 Reference and Sectoral Approaches for Energy Sector
Comparison between the CO2 emissions based on the Reference and Sectoral
Approaches for the energy sector was undertaken. For 2019, the Reference Approach
resulted in emissions of 239,553.42 Gg of CO2 whereas the Sectoral Approach
resulted in an emission of 234,858.00 Gg of CO2 from fuel combustion activities and
4,600.25 Gg CO2 from fugitive emissions (Table 2.2). The percentage difference in
emissions between the sectoral approach (fuel combustion activities) and reference
approach was 1.96%.
2.5.2 Major Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The total GHG emission excluding LULUCF for 2019 was 330,358.21 Gg CO2 eq. and
the total GHG emission including LULUCF was 115,643.68 Gg CO2 eq. (Table 2.2).

Introduction
Efforts continued to be taken by Malaysia to mainstream mitigation actions into its
development through the development and implementation of polices, plans and
programmes that have mitigation co-benefits which at the same time meets the
development needs of the country. Specifically in the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025),
one of the main thrusts is on ‘Advancing Green Growth to Enhance Environmental
Sustainability’. There are three priority areas for this thrust and each priority area has
respective strategies which are as follows:
i.
ii.
iii.
Priority Area A – Implementing a Low-Carbon, Clean and Resilient
Development
• Strategy A1 – Moving Towards a Low-Carbon Nation
• Strategy A2 – Accelerating Transition to the Circular Economy
• Strategy A3 – Sharing Responsibility in Pollution Prevention
• Strategy A4 – Increasing Resilience against Climate Change and
Disasters
Priority Area B – Managing Natural Resources Efficiently to Safeguard Natural
Capital
• Strategy B1 – Conserving Natural Ecosystems
• Strategy B2 – Protecting and Conserving Species and Genetic
Resources
• Strategy B3 – Ensuring Sustainable Utilisation and Benefit Sharing
• Strategy B4 – Enhancing Conservation of Water Resources
Priority Area C – Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Effective
Governance
• Strategy C1 – Strengthening Environmental Governance
• Strategy C2 – Scaling-up Green Financing and Investments
• Strategy C3 – Instilling Sense of Ownership and Shared Responsibility
The emphasis to minimize GHG emissions are highlighted through the green growth
implementation, energy efficiency enhancement and green mobility promotion
initiatives in the 12th Malaysian Plan as well. The awareness of the need to accurately
quantify mitigation actions and their effects is also increasing among the government
agencies and the private sector.
Additional efforts however are required for Malaysia to meet the mitigation targets
stated in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021. That pledge
expressed Malaysia’s commitment to reduce by 45% its GHG emissions per GDP by
2030, relative to its emissions intensity in 2005.
This chapter provides a summary of polices, plans and programmes in place to drive
the mitigation agenda of the country as part of its sustainable development agenda.
An indicative GHG emissions modelling projection on possible mitigation pathways for
Malaysia to fulfil its Paris Agreement target is also provided. The quantified Mitigation
Actions and Their Effects are reported in the Fourth Biennial Update Report.
3.2 National Policy and Framework
A brief description of the updated national Policy and Planning Framework for
mitigation is provided as below.
3.2.1 National Policy on Climate Change
The main policy to guide Government agencies, industry, communities and other
stakeholders in addressing the challenges of climate change in an effective and
holistic manner is provided in the National Policy on Climate Change approved by the
Cabinet in 2009. The policy recognised the need for both mitigation and adaptation to
be carried out in a balanced manner where national responses that consolidate
economic, social and environmental development goals are mainstreamed based on
the following five principles:
Development on a sustainable path: To integrate climate change responses into
national development plans to fulfil the country’s aspiration for sustainable
development;
Conservation of environment and natural resources: To strengthen implementation
of climate change actions that contribute to environmental conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources;
Coordinated implementation: To incorporate climate change considerations into
the implementation of development programmes at all levels;
Effective participation: To improve participation of stakeholders and major groups
for effective implementation of climate change responses; and
Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities:
International involvement on climate change will be based on the principle of
common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
3.2.2 Sectoral Policies
The policies that give effect to mitigation are contained in sectoral polices related to
the energy; transport; IPPU; waste; land use, land-use change and forestry; and
agriculture sectors. These policies are implemented by the respective Ministries and
their associated Agencies through the Malaysia Development Plans.
related key policies. The practical targets of these mitigations are discussed in greater
detail in the respective sections of the GHG emission projection section of this chapter.

3.2.2.1 Energy Management and Conservation
In 2019 the power sector contributed 32% of the country’s GHG emissions. Energy
security and affordable electricity rates to consumers remain the main priorities of the
country. Hence to a large extent, the energy mix for electricity generation is dictated
by population affordability. Nevertheless, efforts are being taken to cap the share of
coal in the energy mix. In addition, efforts continue to be taken to enhance the share
of clean and green energy sources in its electricity generation and at the same time
encouraging energy efficiency in its usage.
The National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) was recently launched in July 2023
with aims to power the future by unlocking potentials in new growth areas and
delivering progress and prosperity to Malaysian households and businesses. The plan
aspires to steer Malaysia’s shift from traditional fossil fuels-based economy to a highvalue green economy. The policies conducted and outlined in this plan will be reported
in the first Biennial Transparency Report of Malaysia in 2024.
Apart from NETR, the Hydrogen Economy and Technology Roadmap (HETR) was
also recently launched in October 2023 with the aims to achieve decarbonisation and
to spearhead the hydrogen economy through the application of hydrogen and its
derivatives. It is a living document for new industrial development propelled by the
applicable technologies and innovations.
Renewable Energy
In the 12th Malaysia Plan, the development and utilisation of renewable energy will be
intensified from 21.5% in 2019 to 31% by the end of the plan in 2025. The focus in the
renewables include greater usage of biomass and biogas, apart from implementation
of power generation from hydro and solar resources. The contribution of mitigation
actions through the RE electricity from solar is estimated to increase through the
increased installed capacity of renewable power sources. The adoption of new
technologies comprising the energy storage system is planned to be promoted to
address the intermittency issue in the renewable energy.
Energy Efficiency
A number of energy efficiency programmes had been reported since the first BUR.
The newest of these is the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan which has been
approved in 2016 for implementation. The NEEAP sets a target to save 52,233 GWh
amount of electricity over a 10-year period from 2016 to 2025 that corresponds to an
electricity demand growth reduction at the end of the plan of about 8.0%. These would
be implemented through five initiatives namely,
Initiative 1: Promotion of 5-Star Rated Appliances;
Initiative 2: Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS);
Initiative 3: Energy Audits and Energy Management in Buildings and Industries;
Initiative 4: Promotion of Co-generation; and
Initiative 5: Energy Efficient Building Design.
Through the implementation of NEEAP initiatives, GHG emissions are expected to be
reduced.
3.2.2.2 Transport
The transport sector has been remained the second largest GHG emitting sector in
the country based on the historical trend, accounting for 20% of the country’s total
GHG emissions in 2019. Of these 20%, about 17% comes from road transportation.
The National Transport Policy (NTP) 2019-2030 has been developed to lay the policy
thrusts and strategies to enhance Malaysia’s economic competitiveness, provide
strong social impact particularly with respect to inclusivity and accessibility, while
reducing the negative impact of the transport system on the environment. It provides
an overarching policy to guide relevant federal ministries and agencies as well as State
Governments and Local Authorities (PBT) to develop and streamline transport
initiatives towards a common goal, resulting in effective and efficient use of resources.
Among the initiatives is to mainstream the shift towards electrification in the
transportation industry as a key strategy to diminish our emissions and contribute
towards the achievement of our national Paris Agreement GHG target. In the urban
areas, especially in the Greater Kuala Lumpur Area, urban rail development had been
implemented since the mid 1990’s.
Continued implementation of the National Biofuel Policy has also resulted in higher
blends of biodiesel being implemented for the transport sector. The B10 programme
has been implemented since the year of 2019. While B20 biodiesel programme
implementation is targeted to start in 2020 with phased nationwide rollout subject to
infrastructure readiness, the B30 biodiesel blending target is to be implemented by
2030 especially for the heavy vehicles.
In the new National Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) described below, the
electric vehicle development is one of the four focusses in the master plan. It is also
one of the four new growth areas identified in the NIMP 2030. There are plannings to
install up to 10,000 charging stations to support the electric vehicle implementation in
Malaysia. To achieve the target, the electric vehicle ecosystem and the supply chain
will need to be strengthened.
3.2.2.3 Industrial Processes and Product Use
Prior to 2020, the development of industries in Malaysia was guided by the Third
Industrial Master Plan 2006-2020. That policy guided Malaysia’s long-term global
competitiveness and innovation of the manufacturing and non-Government services
sectors during that period. It covered 12 industries namely electrical and electronics,
medical devices, textile and apparel, machinery and equipment, metals, transport
equipment, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, wood-based, rubber based, oil-palm
based and food processing. Success of the plan however had attracted investments
in some high energy intensive and high GHG emitting sectors towards the end period
of the plan.
NIMP 2030 was launched in September 2023. This policy aims to drive the next phase
of the country’s industrial development and advance its economic complexity,
particularly in five key sectors: aerospace, digital economy, chemicals and
petrochemicals, electrical and electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Among its missions
is to push towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial
sector through:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
accelerating transition towards sustainable practices in the industrial sector;
enhancing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy;
catalysing low carbon technologies and carbon capture as new growth areas;
advancing circular economy and industrial waste management; and
shifting towards green infrastructure.
The plan would help to quicken early peaking of greenhouse gas emissions from the
industrial sector and there after guide its greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards
net zero as early as 2050.
The NIMP 2030 is a planning follow up to the New Investment Policy which was
launched in October 2022. The New Investment Policy takes a comprehensive
approach to catalyse high-quality investments to deliver forward-looking and equitable
growth for the nation. One of the top line targets is sustained economic and wealth
growth at 4.5-5.0% GDP growth per annum and GNI per capita growth at 5.5-6.0%
per annum. It aspires to enhance environmental, social and corporate governance
practices and de-risk the economy against these factors.
3.2.2.4 Waste Management
As stated in Chapter 2, without LULUCF, the waste sector contributed about 9% of the
country’s GHG emissions. The GHG emissions from this sector come mainly from
methane emissions from solid waste disposal sites and from Palm Oil Mill Effluents
(POME). The National Solid Waste Management Policy 2016 and the 12th Malaysia
Plan (2021-2025) set a target of 40% recycling rate by 2025. The 12 th Malaysia Plan
also envisages that all seven types of waste (solid, sewage, scheduled waste,
agriculture, construction and radioactive) shall be managed in a holistic manner based
on a life-cycle approach, with increase investment to channel waste away from waste
disposal sites to be used as a resource, either as input for other products or converted
to energy. Such processes would help to reduce waste generation and contribute to
GHG emissions reduction.
Reducing methane emissions from POME continues to be encouraged through
Developing Biogas Facilities at Palm Oil Mills. Through this programme, palm oil mills
are encouraged to install biogas trapping facilities to capture methane as fuel for their
use or to generate electricity for sale to the national grid. In 2014 the Government
mandated new palm oil mills and old mills that are expanding their capacity to install
methane avoidance facilities. However, uptake has been slower than anticipated with
only 130 facilities being installed by 2020.
3.2.2.5 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
The LULUCF sector plays an important role in Malaysia’s action to address climate
change. This sector remains a net sink while contributing to the nation’s GDP. Hence
it is necessary to continue to strengthen the sustainable forest management efforts of
the country and enhance the forest reserves.
The management of all types of forests is enshrined in the Malaysia Policy on Forestry
(MPF) or other relevant State Forests Policy. This policy provides greater uniformity in
implementing strategies for achieving forest conservation, management, and social
and educational needs. It represents an important policy framework, which is
unequivocal in maintaining that forest management must fulfil environmental and
conservational needs besides meeting rational economic production goals. It provides
a reference, guidelines and strong emphasis on the necessity for sound management,
conservation, utilisation, development and protection of the forests for the three
regions namely Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak. This commitment is duly recognised
and given specific attention by the National Forestry Act 1984 (Amendment 2022)
(NFA). In Sabah, the necessary legal backing is provided by the Sabah Forest
Enactment 1968, Forest Rules 1969 and Forest (Timber) Enactment 2015 while in
Sarawak the Sarawak’ Forests Ordinance 2015 (Cap.71), provides the necessary
legal framework.
To ensure sustainable forest management, a National Committee on Sustainable
Forest Management in Malaysia comprising representatives from various agencies in
the forestry sector was formed in 1994 to ensure that the International Tropical Timber
Organisation’s (ITTO) Criteria and Indicators on sustainable forest management are
fully implemented. The standard used to asses Forest Management Units (FMUs) for
the purpose of certification is the MC&I Standard of Performance for Forest
Management [MC&I (2001)] which is based on the 1998 ITTO Criteria and Indicator
for Sustainable Management of Natural Tropical Forest. The key elements for
sustainable forest management would cover economic, social, environmental and
conservational aspects.
To ensure sustainable harvesting of timber, a forest certification scheme was started
from 2002 with the adoption of the Malaysian Criteria and Indicators (MC&I) for
Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) certification. The maximum cutting limit has
been capped at 85 m3/ha. The Malaysian Timber Certification Council was established
in October 1998 as an independent organisation to develop and operate the Malaysian
Timber Certification Scheme (MTCS). The MTCS provides for independent
assessment of forest management practices, to ensure the sustainable management
of Malaysia’s natural forest as well as to meet the demand for certified timber products.
For 2020, a total of 5,139,745.36 ha of natural forests and 132,989.48 ha of forest
plantations have been certified under the MTCS Programme for the Endorsement of
Forest Certification (PEFC) Scheme.
Under the 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), efforts were taken on forest enrichment to
improve degraded forests. Programmes such as the Central Forest Spine in
Peninsular Malaysia and the Heart of Borneo programme in Sabah and Sarawak serve
as enablers to enhance connectivity between forests, reduce fragmentation and at the
same time improve natural resource management. This is continued in the 12 th
Malaysia Plan, (2021-2025) where the government has committed to ‘Advancing
Green Growth for Sustainability and Resilience’. In the main ’Game Changers’,
reducing dependency on natural resources and maintaining at least 50% forest cover
has been listed as one of its targets.
A REDD plus Strategy has been developed and adopted in 2017. The Strategy
outlines policy actions to ensure at least 50% of Malaysia’s land mass remains as
forest. This is achieved through enhancing sustainable forest management,
conservation activities and seeking synergies with activities under the National Policy
on Biological Diversity 2016-2025.

3.2.2.6 Agriculture
The development of the agriculture sector in Malaysia is guided by the National
Agrofood Policy 2021—2030 (NAP2.0) and the National Agricommodity Policy (20212030), which respectively aim to increase food production and exports of industrial
commodities. The objectives of the National Agrofood Policy are to ensure food
security and that the food produced is safe to eat; to make the agro-food industry
competitive and sustainable; and to increase the agro-based entrepreneur’s level of
income.
Without LULUCF, agriculture accounts for 3% of Malaysia’s GHG emissions in 2019.
Synthetic fertiliser usage accounts for about 31.6% of these emissions and efforts are
being made to optimise fertiliser application.
Two certification schemes guide sustainable agriculture implementation in Malaysia.
The Malaysian Good Agricultural Practices (MyGAP) launched in 2013 is a
comprehensive certification scheme for the agricultural, aquaculture and livestock
sectors. The Malaysian Organic Scheme (currently known as MyOrganic) launched in
2007 is a certification programme to recognise organically cultivated farms which do
not use chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers.
For the commodity crops, increase of exports is to be met by increase in yield per
hectare. Oil palm is the largest of these commodity crops and both the upstream and
downstream activities of this sector are being improved to address land use
competition. As of 2019, about 5.90 million ha were planted with oil palm in Malaysia
and the maximum arable land for this crop is estimated at 6.5 million ha in 2020. The
anticipated increase in global demand for vegetable oil will be met through increased
oil yield per hectare. The National Agricommodity Policy and Action Plan 2021-2030
targeted an increase of average oil yield of 3.47 tonnes per hectare in 2019 to 3.70
tonnes per hectare by 2025 and 4.0 tonnes per hectare by 2030. The average fresh
fruit bunch (FFB) yield is targeted to increase from 17.19 tonnes per hectare in 2019
to 18.25 tonnes per hectare by 2025 and 19.5 tonnes per hectare per year by 2030.
Environmental performance regulations and sustainability criteria are complied with
through the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO), Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) and other sustainability certification schemes. Currently, all big oil
palm plantations are MSPO or RSPO certified to ensure environmental sustainability.
The National Agricommodity Policy 2021-2030 targeted all oil palm plantations to be
MSPO certified by 2030.
3.2.3 Malaysia Development Plans
The ambition of the sectoral polices described in sections are operationalised through
the five-year Malaysia Development Plans. Due to competing needs of the different
areas, implementation is dependent on the availability of development funds which is
tied to the economic growth during the period.
It is useful to note that the 11th Malaysia Plan provides the supports to address climate
change through the emphasizing of sustainability. The 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025)
described in the introduction takes these efforts further by having the strategic priority
areas and the supporting initiatives. The fundamental shift is towards a development
model that views resilient, low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially inclusive
development as an investment that will yield future gains. The 12th Malaysia Plan
(2021-2025) had set advancing sustainability as one of its three themes. Driving
decarbonisation of the energy sector through greater deployment of renewable energy
is one of the focusses.
3.3
GHG Emission Projection
This section presents an assessment on Malaysia’s GHG emission projection. The
assessment had been carried out for the period from 2020 until 2030 for the five
sectors namely Energy, IPPU, Waste, Agriculture and LULUCF. Three key scenarios
have been explored in the assessment. In the Without Measures (WOM) scenario, the
GHG emissions are projected based on a “no additional policy intervention” criterion.
The With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario takes into account the existing policies
and planned initiatives in 2019 that would be implemented until 2030. The With
Additional Measures (WAM) scenario looks at potential emissions reduction when
additional mitigation measures are implemented.
3.3.1 GHG Emission Projection Assumptions
The assumptions applied include the applicable sectoral and population growths are
based on the pre-COVID-19 condition. The projection for the WOM scenario used
population information as the Table 3.3 and GDP growth is based on the assumptions
as the Table 3.4.
Key Note:
The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the end of 2019 and relatively ended in
2022 is estimated to cause a decrease of energy demand due to domestic lockdown
which contributes to a lower value of energy supply. During the preparation works
of NC4, actual energy data for the year of 2020 was still in the process of publication
by the related agency. Hence, the projection for the year of 2020 and onwards is
based on the pre-COVID-19 condition assumptions.
The updates pertaining to the actual energy data for 2020 and 2021 as well a
relatively updated projection will be reported in the next reporting document e.g. the
First Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1).

The macroeconomics projections up to 2030 are then used to generate energy
demand functions using the regression software Microfit2. The energy demand
functions generated then is used to estimate the final energy demand and supply
projections and GHG emissions for the energy sector.
3.3.2 Summary of GHG Emission Projection Results
The projection indicates that the total emissions without LULUCF for Malaysia would
be 481,363 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM case by 2030 (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.5).
Continued implementation of the planned activities under the WEM scenario would
bring the emissions down to 367,603 Gg CO2 eq. If further mitigation activities under
the WAM scenario are carried out, the GHG emissions could reduce to 337,554 Gg
CO2 eq. The mitigation assumptions for each of the scenarios and sectors are
described in section 3.3.3.
and WAM Scenarios
The energy sector is projected to continue to be the largest contributor of GHG
emissions in 2030 followed by the IPPU and waste sectors. For the WEM scenario
without LULUCF, the GHG emissions from the energy sector is likely to be 80% of the
total emissions in 2030. This is followed by the IPPU sector at around 11%, the waste
sector at about 6% and the agriculture sector at 3%. For the WAM scenario without
LULUCF, the energy sector is likely to account for 78% of the emissions in 2030. This
is followed by the IPPU sector at 13%, the waste sector at 7% and the agriculture
sector at 3%.

three aforementioned mitigation scenarios, WOM, WEM and WAM. Some of the
mitigation actions listed in the table for the WEM and WAM scenarios are lower in
target compared to the policy aspirations in Table 3.1 due to financial and technical
limitations in implementing those targets. These more realistic targets adopted for the

In all the three mitigation scenarios, the energy demand is projected to continue to
grow in tandem with the increasing population and GDP. The modelling results
indicate that energy demand will grow from 68.9 Mtoe3 in 2020 to 90.7 Mtoe in 2030
in the WOM scenario and from 68.5 Mtoe in 2020 to 90.5 Mtoe by 2030 for the WEM
scenario. For WAM scenario, the energy demand in 2020 and 2030 will be 68.0 Mtoe
and 89.8 Mtoe respectively (Figure 3.2). The results indicate that more aggressive
energy efficiency programmes across the sectors need to be put in place to reduce
the demand.

In-depth analysis of the final energy demand by the different sub-sectors under the
three scenarios showed that transport sector will continue to be the highest energy
consumer up to 2030, followed by manufacturing industries and construction (Figure
3.3). Together these two sub-sectors are expected to account for 63% of energy
demand in 2030, with the transport and manufacturing industries and construction
sectors accounting for about 36 % and 27 % of the energy demand respectively in

In tandem with the growth in energy demand, the GHG emissions for the energy sector
for WOM scenario will also to grow over the projected time period (Figure 3.4).
However, the GHG emission for the WEM and WAM scenarios will be relatively lower
than WOM due to the effects of the aforementioned mitigation measures in the WEM
and WAM scenarios.

and WAM Scenarios
The WOM scenario is projected to have the highest GHG emission growth rate from
among the three scenarios, with an annual growth rate of 2.5% from 2020 to 2030.
Under the WEM scenario, where existing mitigation policies are implemented, the
emissions are expected to be reduced by 6.4% (17,506 Gg CO2 eq) by 2020 and up
to 22.7% (79,242 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030, relative to the WOM scenario. Further emission
reductions are anticipated in the WAM scenario i.e. by 6.4% (18,043 Gg CO2 eq) from
the WOM scenario by 2020 and 28.7% (100,035 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030.
Analysis of the projected GHG emissions for each of the energy sub-sectors (Table
3.6) indicates that GHG emissions from the electricity sector would continue to be the
largest emitter. However, the magnitude of GHG emission is estimated to be reduced
in both WEM and WAM scenarios. In the WEM scenario, the GHG emissions will
decrease from 101,206 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 98,657 Gg CO2 eq in 2030. For the WAM
scenario, GHG emissions is estimated at 100,622 CO2 eq and 91,442 CO2 eq in 2020
and 2030 each. These results indicate that increase of RE capacity in power
generation and energy efficiency initiatives are necessary to help reduce emissions
from this sub-sector.
The largest increase in GHG emissions in the energy sector comes from the
manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector, increasing from 35,416 Gg CO2
eq in 2020 to 55,580 CO2eq in 2030 for the WEM scenario. In 2020 and 2030, the
value of estimated GHG emissions is 35,391 and 55,544 CO2 eq respectively under
the WAM scenario. These increases will require further effort to reduce the GHG
emissions of the manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector through certain
initiatives and policies while supporting the competitiveness of the industry.
The second largest increase in projected GHG emissions is from the transportation
sub-sector, increasing from 63,382 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 66,334 Gg CO2eq in 2030
for WEM scenario and from 62,104 Gg CO2 eq to 64,473 Gg CO2 eq in 2030 under
WAM scenario.
In the projections, the GHG emissions from the natural gas transformation GHG for
WOM scenario are assumed to remain around the range of the 2019 values for the
projection period. The GHG emissions reduction projected for the WEM and WAM
scenarios are based on the mitigation actions mentioned in Table 3.6. For the fugitive
emissions from the oil and gas industry, the mitigation actions for reduction are shown
in Table 3.7.

3.3.3.2 Industrial Processes and Product Use Sector
From the GHG Inventory, within this sector in 2019, the metal industry contributed the
highest share (39.8%) of the sector’s GHG emissions, followed by mineral industry
(30.7%), the chemical industry (17.5%) and the electronics industry (8.5%). GHG
emissions from industrial processes however were projected to increase in these subsectors over the next decade due to expansion of production capacity, especially in
the iron and steel industry. Emissions from the iron and steel industry would depend
on control on the number and capacity of iron and steel mills approved for production.
Except for the cement and iron and steel industries, differences in the GHG emissions
between WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios for the other sub-sectors in this
assessment were basically based on production growth rates.
Production of cement in Malaysia increased from 16.66 million tonnes in 2005 to 20.04
million tonnes in 2019. The cement production is projected to grow at about 2.5% per
year until 2030, based on the existing capacity of 48.959 million tonnes per annum
and with an operating capacity of 41%. Cement production in Malaysia is highly
concentrated, with the top five players having a total market share of 90%.
Reduction of emissions from energy usage has been taken into account in the energy
sector calculations, hence this section shall only concentrate on the option of
decreasing the share of clinker in cement production by adding additives like fly ash.
In the first Biennial Update Report (BUR1), it has been recommended that the cement
industry in Malaysia could reduce its clinker ratio to 0.75:1 by the year 2030 to help
reduce emissions from cement production. Based on this, the proposed clinker content
per tonne of cement in the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios are as shown in Table
3.8.

Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the projected GHG emission growths in
all the three scenarios for the IPPU sector is as shown in Figure 3.5 and Table 3.9.
Here the GHG emissions for each of the sub-sector is estimated for the projection
period based on each sub-sector’s projected production and using the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines. The GHG emission is projected to grow from 32,853 Gg CO2 eq in 2019 to
82,462 Gg CO2 eq, 56,585 Gg CO2 eq and 50,662 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM, WEM and
WAM scenarios respectively in 2030.

3.3.3.3 Agriculture
As mentioned earlier food security is one of the key concerns of Malaysia. In 2019
emissions from the agriculture sector was about 9,922 Gg CO2 eq., with direct N2O
emissions from managed soils accounting for about 3,737 Gg CO2 eq. (37.7%) of the
emissions and rice cultivations accounting for about 2,269 Gg CO2 eq. (22.9%) of the
emissions. Increasing self-sufficiency in food production especially livestock would
lead to increase level of GHG emissions.
Reducing emissions from the agriculture sector through good agriculture practices
would include optimising the usage of synthetic fertiliser for crop yield. This can be
achieved by applying what is commonly known as the 4R’s:
Right N application rate
Right formulation (fertiliser type)
Right timing of application, and
Right placement
Discussions with the agriculture research institutions indicate the possibility of
reduction of about 10% of synthetic fertiliser application through the 4R strategy for oil
palm cultivation, the largest crop under cultivation in Malaysia. The assumption for
reducing synthetic fertiliser application for the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios for the
agriculture sector is as shown in Table 3.10.

Assume that the
application rate of
nitrogenous fertilisers
reduces by 10% from
2020 onwards
through optimum
application of
synthetic fertiliser.
Efforts are also being taken to limit the areas under oil palm cultivation. While the
WOM scenario would likely see oil palm cultivation reaching 7 million hectares, efforts
are being taken by the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities to restrict oil palm
cultivation to a maximum land usage of 6.5 million hectares by 2030 which was used
for the WEM and WAM modelling scenarios.
For rice cultivations, increasing productivity per hectare of paddy planted area
especially in the irrigated granaries, would reduce the need of additional land for rice
cultivation. The National Agrofood Policy 2.0 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0) and Action Plan
targeted a productivity of 7 tonnes of paddy yield per hectare especially in the
granaries by 2030. This scenario was used for the WAM case, while the WEM used a
mid-value productivity yield value of 5.7 tonnes of paddy per planted by 2030 and the
WOM scenario used the 2005-2019 average productivity yield of 4.576 tonnes per
hectare of granary planted area.
Livestock population emissions were modelled based on the full achievement of NAP
2.0 meat and dairy self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) targets for the WOM case and the 66%
achievement of NAP 2.0 SSR targets for the WEM case based on historical trends
and from reverse investment initiatives. While the achievement of the 33% SSR
objective for the WAM is because of food imports contributing to a decrease in GHG
emissions.
Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the projected GHG emissions for the three
scenarios for the agriculture sector is as shown in Figure 3.6 and Table 3.11. The
projections indicated that the GHG emissions for the agriculture sector would grow
from 9.922 Gg CO2 eq. in 2019 to 16,256 Gg CO2 eq., 13,615 Gg CO2 eq. and 11,309
Gg CO2 eq. under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios in 2030.

3.3.3.4 Waste
GHG emissions from the waste sector arise from two major sources, i.e., solid waste
disposal and wastewater treatment and discharge (domestic and industrial), where
most of the emissions are in the form of methane. Out of the 28,257 Gg CO 2 eq. of
GHG emissions from this sector in 2019, industrial waste water treatment and
discharge contributed 51% (14,462 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions with nearly 99% of
this part of the emission coming from POME. Solid waste disposal sites contributed
41% (11,681 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions and domestic waste water contributed 7%
(2,065 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions.
Logically the mitigation efforts in this sector should be focused on reducing methane
emissions from solid waste disposal sites and from POME. Table 3.12 is a summary
of the mitigation actions assumed for the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios in the
projection. The assumptions for recycling follow closely the targets set in the policies.
For methane recovery from POME, although the earlier policies proposed the
implementation of biogas capture facilities for 500 palm oil mills by 2020, the uptake
by that industry has been slower than expected where in 2019 only 125 out of 452
palm oil mills have been fully equipped with biogas capture facilities. Based on
discussions with the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities and the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board (MPOB) it is projected that the yearly increment of mills with biogas capture
would be five per year. It is evident that greater push for implementation of biogas
capture facilities in palm oil mills is needed.

the WOM, WEM and WAM mitigation scenarios. The results indicate that GHG
emissions from the waste sector would grow from 28,257 Gg CO2 eq in 2019 to 34,094
Gg CO2 eq. and 28,095 CO2 eq. under the WOM and WEM scenarios respectively in
2030. However, under the WAM scenario the GHG emissions from the waste sector
could reduce to 27,067 Gg CO2 eq. in 2030. This could be achieved by diverting
organic wastes away from landfills for treatment and greater implementation ambition
on establishing biogas capture facilities at palm oil mills as well as better flaring
efficiency and usage of the methane captured in these facilities for energy generation.

3.3.3.5 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
Of the five categories of land use under the IPCC categories, forest and crop land are
the most important categories. These two categories account for more than 75% of
the total land use of Malaysia. Some of the wetlands like peatland is reported in both
forest and cropland. Mitigation potential for grassland and wetlands are relatively small
while assessment for settlements is being undertaken.
Net Forest Change
Malaysia’s deforestation rates stabilised, between 2009 to 2015 there was no net
forest loss. However, the increasing population (estimated to reach 38 million by 2030)
together with increased demand for food, transportation and other infrastructures puts
pressure on forest.
Projected forest loss between 2020 and 2030 was derived from historic rate of forest
conversion. Figure 3.8 shows the projected forest cover until 2030. Forest loss of
65,000 ha per year is expected under the WOM scenario between 2020 and 2030
while in the WEM and WAM scenarios, 50,000 ha and 47,000 ha respectively were
projected to be lost annually over the same period.
Based on these scenarios, Malaysia would still maintain 52.7%, 53.1% and 53.2% of
its total land area as forest under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively in
2030 (Table 3.14).

Sustainable Forest Management
With the implementation of sustainable forest management and forest certification, the
maximum harvest is limited to 85m3/ha and follows all the principles, criteria and
indicators set in Malaysia Criteria and Indicator (MC&I). The historical rate of decrease
in wood harvest is about 4% per annum from 2005 to 2019. The current scenarios do
not include potential enhancement of carbon stocks in degraded forest especially
when forest corridors are established. It only considered the increment in carbon
stocks, drained organic soils and commercial harvest.
For the mitigation assessment, a conservative assumption was made for the projected
commercial wood harvest. For all the three scenarios wood harvest are projected to
increase from 2020 to 2025 and then reduce from then onwards to 2030 (Table 3.15).
By 2030, with the decreasing harvest rate from 2025 onwards, the projected
commercial harvest is around 16.051 million m3 per year, 14.891 million m3 per year
and 13.726 million m3 per year for WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively.

Cropland
The expansion of cropland area is limited in Malaysia due to limited arable land
targeted for agriculture. Labour shortage has also resulted in abandoned farms
especially for rubber and rice cultivation. The current trend in oil palm expansion
comes primarily from abandoned cropland and this trend may continue. The projected
growth in the cropland is focused on enhancing productivity of the smallholders
engaged in commodity tree crops like oil palm and rubber. The expansion of tree crops
under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios are shown in Table 3.16.

Projected LULUCF Emissions and Removals
For the forest category, enhancing sustainable forest management (SFM) and
conservation would reduce emission. The implementation of CFS and HoB have
potential to increase forest connectivity and enhance removals. It is anticipated that
future supply of wood from the plantation forest would increase and lesser harvesting
would occur from natural forest. Deforestation would occur in the State Land Forest.
Biomass loss of 140t d.m./ha, 127t d.m./ha and 144t d.m./ha for forest, oil palm and
rubber respectively were applied in the calculation of GHG emissions. For
deforestation, it is assumed that all of the above ground biomass is removed.
For Cropland, marginal increase in removals is anticipated while conversion of
cropland to settlement would also be stabilised. It is anticipated that 7,600 ha of rubber
plantation and 2,000 ha of oil palm will be converted to settlement on annual basis
respectively.
The total emission and removals from forest and crop land is shown in Table 3.17
under the three scenarios.

Plan for Improvement
As mitigation actions through different policies and programmes are being
implemented across the different Ministries and Agencies, a coherent and robust
Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System is necessary for keeping
track of the integrated impacts of these implementations in reducing the GHG
emissions in the country. A step-wise approach has been taken in developing this
system in Malaysia with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental
Sustainability as the Secretariat to the Technical Working Group of Mitigation and
Technical Working Group on Transparency and Related Activities.
In moving strategic directions in implementing the policies that will give effect to GHG
emission reduction, one of the critical information that is sought by policymakers is
accurate information on projection of future GHG emissions. The current efforts in
modelling the projected emissions are the efforts in providing such information for
informed decisions making on strategic directions for implementing mitigation actions.
More accurate modelling is required, in particular those coupled with accurate
information on abatement costs. Moving towards more sophisticated models would
be attempted.
4. VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND ADAPTATION MEASURES
4.1
Introduction
Vulnerability assessment and adaptation measures are an important component of
the national response to address climate change as highlighted in Malaysia’s First
Update of Nationally Determined Contribution 2021 (NDC 2021) to the UNFCCC. As
described in chapter one of this report, the country has experienced increased
minimum, mean and maximum air temperatures. The rainfall intensity has also
increased. Over the last two decades more weather extremes had been experienced
by the country. Major floods occurred in 2010, 2012 and 2014, 2021 and 2022 with
the 2014 northeast monsoon floods being one of the worst in recorded history. In
2016, a very strong El Niño resulted in prolonged dry periods and associated water
shortages, heat waves and wildfires. Consequently, economic losses have also
increased.
Building resilience to natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change
requires systematic vulnerability and adaptation assessment. The vulnerability and
adaptation assessment reported in this chapter captures the progress made in climate
change projection as well as sectoral vulnerability and impact assessment since NC3.
This chapter on vulnerability assessment and adaptation measures is
concurrently submitted as Malaysia’s First Adaptation Communication
pursuant to the Paris Agreement, which was prepared taking into account
Decision 9/CMA.1.
4.2
Institutional Arrangement
The institutional arrangement for V&A assessment is shown in Figure 1.10 and the
implementation arrangement is shown in this report. The Technical Working Group on
Vulnerability and Adaptation (TWG V&A) is chaired by the National Water Research
Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) under the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environmental Sustainability (NRES) Malaysia and supported by six Sub-Working
Groups (SWGs). The six SWGs are led by the following ministries and agencies as

For the V&A assessments, the same sectors as reported in NC3 with some additional
sub-sectors were assessed in this report (Table 4.2). The assessment on impacts of
floods, dry spells, extreme high temperatures and extreme wet events, were carried
out based on the hydroclimate data projected under the RCP 6.0, while the
assessment on impacts of SLR and coastal inundation were carried out based on the
sea level data projected under the RCP 8.5.
The RCP 6.0 scenario was chosen since this RCP is almost similar to the SRES A1B
that was used in NC3 as well as being close to the current anthropogenic global
warming rate. For SLR, the RCP 8.5 was chosen in order to take into account the
impacts of other coastal hazard such as storm surges and wind generated wave which
are not included in the static SLR vulnerability assessment that was adopted in this
report.

Projected Hydroclimate
4.4.1 Air Temperature
Projected average annual air temperatures for the periods of early-century, mid-century
and late-century for the hydrological regions of the country, is shown in Figure 4.1. The
average annual air temperatures for the whole country showed an increasing trend and
could increase by 0.5-0.8 oC in early-century, 1.1-1.5 oC by mid-century, and 1.7-2.1
oC by late-century. Among the regions, Region SW-1 in Sarawak was estimated with
the highest increment throughout the century.
4.4.2 Rainfall
As shown in Figure 4.2, all the hydrological regions in the country are expected to face
increments of average annual rainfall throughout the century. Overall, the regions in
Sabah and Sarawak showed higher increments during the early-century (6.7-15.2%),
mid-century (11.2-19.4%) and late-century (14.8-25.4%) timelines. In Peninsular
Malaysia, the increments for early-century, mid-century and late-century were 3.58.0%, 7.8-11.9% and 8.9-12.5%, respectively. Among the regions, Region SW-3 in
Sarawak may face the highest increment throughout the century. By the late-century,
extreme high average annual rainfalls could be expected at Region SW-1 (4,619 mm)
and Region SW-3 (4,336 mm) in Sarawak, and Region SB-3 (4,262 mm) in Sabah.
4.4.3 Flood Areal Extent
There are 191 river basins in Malaysia, and of these, 144 river basins (86 in Peninsular
Malaysia, 32 in Sabah and 26 in Sarawak) are prone to flooding. Detailed studies to
quantify climate change impacts on flood areal extent has thus far, been conducted for
17 major flood areal extent basins in Peninsular Malaysia (Table 4.3 and Figure 4.3);
10 major flood prone basins in Sabah and 10 major flood prone basins in Sarawak
(Table 4.3 and Figure 4.4). The total area of these river basins is about 232,002 km2,
which covers 70.3% of Malaysia’s land area.
The flood assessments in Malaysia are based on flood extent maps associated with a
100-year Return Period for the time horizons projection of 2100. The assessments
showed that the river basins in Peninsular Malaysia are more vulnerable to floods
compared to those river basins in Sabah and Sarawak. The flood areal extent of the
river basins in Peninsular Malaysia are anticipated to increase by 18.2% from the
baseline timeline (1971-2000) to 2100. A smaller increase of 5.2% and 3.5% were
projected for Sabah and Sarawak respectively, for the same time horizon.

Under the future scenario, majority of the river basins in Peninsular Malaysia, except
for Johor river basin and Muda river basin, could have more than 15% increment in
their flood prone areas up to 2100, with Kerian river basin in Perak’s increment possibly
reaching 33.7 %. Other high risk river basins could include Batu Pahat river basin
(+25.4 %), Kemaman river basin (+23.0 %), Kuantan river basin (+21.8 %), Kesang
river basin (+20.9 %), Selangor river basin (+20.9 %) and Setiu river basin (+20.7 %).
In Sabah, the flood prone areas at Sg Kalumpang river basin, Sg Sinsilog river basin,
Trusan Kinabatangan river basin, Sg Segama river basin, Sg Tuaran river basin, Sg
Papar river basin and Sg Labuk river basin were projected to increase up to 2100 with
the highest increment anticipated at Sg Tuaran river basin (+17.6%). In Sarawak, the
situation could be more moderate as compared to Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah,
where majority of the river basins could face less than 5% of increment except for
Batang Baram river basin (+9.2%), Sg Sarawak river basin (+9.3%), Batang Kemena
river basin (+7.4%) and Batang Saribas river basin (+6.7%).

4.4.4 Dry Spells
Occurrences of dry spells had been analysed based on the projected annual rainfall up
to 2050. The results are presented according to the river basins and regions in Figure
4.5, where the number of occurrences for each return period are shown with
histograms. The occurrences of dry spells are indicated by return periods since the
design safe yield for water supply is usually based on the 50-year return period.
Although all the river basins and regions showed occurrences of dry spells, however
the analysis showed that severe dry spells with return periods more than 50 years (up
to 25.5% of annual rainfall reduction) could occur only at some of the river basins and
regions with one or two occurrences.
The assessment of severities of dry spells with respect to a 50-year return period
showed that the most severe dry spells could occur at regions of Coastal 10 and
Coastal 11 in Peninsular Malaysia, where a reduction of more than 1,200 mm of rainfall
is expected (Figure 4.6). Severe dry spells with annual rainfall reductions of 801-1,200
mm could occur at Coastal 12 region in Peninsular Malaysia. Moderate reductions of
401-800 mm annual rainfall are expected at Kemaman, Sadong, Saribas, Kadamaian
and Southern Sabah. No rainfall reductions were projected at regions of Coastal 2,
Coastal 3, Coastal 4 and Coastal 5 in Peninsular Malaysia. Projection results showed
that the southern region and east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, and Sarawak, are
subject to lesser reductions than other regions.

4.4.5 Extreme Events
Extreme Dry Events
Dry events had been analysed based on the projected rainfall for the period of 20202100 (Figure 4.7). The rainfall variability index (RVI) was applied to indicate the severity
of the dry spells. The analysis showed that extreme dry events could occur in Sabah in
the early-century, where Region 7, Region 8, Region 9, Sg. Segama river basin, Sg.
Kalabakan river basin and Sg. Kalumpang river basin would have RVIs between -3.01
and -4.00 corresponding to annual rainfall reduction of 26.6% to 38.6% respectively.
Among these river basins, Region 8 was projected to be the most severely affected
river basin with rainfall reduction of 1,247 mm from the baseline.
Very dry events with RVIs from -2.01 to -3.00 corresponding to annual rainfall reduction
of 12.4% to 19.8% respectively could occur in Region 10 in Sabah, and Coastal 5,
Coastal 6, Coastal 7, Coastal 9, Batu Pahat river basin and Johor river basin in
Peninsular Malaysia, during the early-century and mid-century.
Extreme Wet Events
Wet events had been analysed using the same index and same period of projected
rainfall. The analysis showed that extreme wet events (level 5) with RVIs ranging from
+6.51 to +8.50 corresponding to annual rainfall increment of 42.5% to 62.6%
respectively could occur at Batang Tatau river basin, Batang Samarahan river basin,
Batang Lupar river basin, Batang Sadong river basin, Sg. Sarawak river basin, Batang
Kemena river basin, Batang Balingian river basin, Batang Mukah river basin, Batang
Kerian river basin, Region 1, Batang Oya river basin and Batang Saribas river basin in
Sarawak (Figure 4.8). Other river basins such as Batang Baram river basin, Batang
Terusan river basin and Batang Rajang river basin could have extreme wet events
(level 4) with lower RVI from +5.51 to +6.50 corresponding to annual rainfall increment
of 35.4% to 38.3% respectively. Similar situation could also occur in Region 4 and Sg.
Padas river basin in Sabah, and Coastal 1 in Peninsular Malaysia.
The majority of the remaining river basins and regions in Peninsular Malaysia could
experience extreme wet events (level 3) with RVI from +4.51 to +5.50 corresponding
to annual rainfall increment of 23.4% to 53.0% respectively. The same is expected in
Sg. Labuk river basin, Sg. Sugut river basin, Trusan Kinabatangan river basin, Sg.
Papar river basin and Region 10 in Sabah, and Sg. Limbang river basin and Region 2
in Sarawak.
4.4.6 Climate Change Factor
The conventional design capacity of water infrastructure system and components
based on historical rainfall has become insufficient due to more extreme short and long
duration rainfall intensity. In order to improve the adequacy of the design, a climate
change factor (CCF) that quantifies the scale of rainfall intensity changes needs to be
developed and applied. The CCF is defined as the ratio of the projected future design
rainfall to the historical design rainfall.
CCFs have been developed based on annual maximum rainfall for each of the nine
durations (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72-hour) with different return periods (2, 5,
10, 50 and 100-year) for 42 river basins in Peninsular Malaysia and 39 river basins in
Sabah and Sarawak. The CCF for 1-hour and 24-hour rainfall durations with 100-year
return period is shown in Figure 4.9. It was found that all the CCFs in Malaysia are
greater than 1.00 with CCFs in Sabah and Sarawak slightly higher than those in
Peninsular Malaysia.
In general, Sarawak is projected with higher percentage increments than in Sabah and
Peninsular Malaysia. Among the 81 basins, Oya in Sarawak is the only basin projected
with more than 30% of increment in future rainfall due to climate change. Other basins
in Sarawak such as Mukah, Limbang, Baram, Northern Sarawak, Tatau, Balingian,
Kerian, Saribas and Lupar also show a high increment of 26-30%. Coastal in Peninsular
Malaysia and some basins in Sabah (Beluran, Sandakan, Sg. Segama, Lahad Datu,
Sg. Kalumpang, Tawau and Sg. Kalabakan) also show the similar range.
In Sabah, all the remaining basins are projected to show percentage increments of 2125%. The same percentage increments are also reflected in Sarawak (Lawas, Terusan,
Kemena and Rajang) and Peninsular Malaysia (Johor, Linggi, Klang, Buloh, Tengi
Selangor, Kurau, Perak, Kerian, Perai, Pulau Pinang, Perlis, Langkawi, Kelantan,
Merchang, Dungun, Kemaman and Kuantan). Other basins in Sarawak and Peninsular
Malaysia are expected to show 16-20% of increment only.
Malaysia
4.4.7 Sea Level Rise
SLR was projected at selected tidal stations for the current timeline (2022), 2050 and
2100 with respect to sea level in 2015 as baseline (Table 4.4). The ranges of maximum
sea level value were then estimated at the same stations for the same periods (Figure
4.10).
The Malaysian coastline was projected to face a maximum SLR of 0.25 m by 2050 and
0.74 m by 2100. Sabah is expected to have higher SLR than Sarawak and Peninsular
Malaysia by 2050 and 2100, where the SLR up to 0.74 m could be faced at the Kudat
coastline by 2100. Sarawak coastlines could have moderate values between the two.
In Peninsular Malaysia, the west coast was projected with lower SLR impact than the
east coast.

4.4.8 Coastal Inundation
Coastal inundation along Malaysia shorelines was assessed and presented for the
projected current timeline (2022), 2050 and 2100 (Table 4.5). The projected coastal
inundation areas due to SLR along Malaysia coastline could increase from the current
5,255 km2 to 6,144 km2 and 9,295 km2 by 2050 and 2100, respectively. The potential
total inundated areas could increase by 16.9% and 76.9% by 2050 and 2100
respectively, compared to the current timeline. The most vulnerable coastline was
projected to be located in Sabah, followed by Selangor in Peninsular Malaysia and
Sarawak. The west coast of Peninsular Malaysia along the Straits of Malacca could be
more vulnerable to coastal flooding compared to the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

Water and Coastal Resources
4.5.1 Impact and Vulnerability
Reservoir Storage and Dam Security
In 2021, for Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, almost 98.7% of
potable water supply is from surface water sources, primarily through abstractions from
run-of-river (81.9%), and direct abstractions from reservoirs (16.8%), while the
remaining 1.3% is from groundwater. Based on the SPAN report on water supply dams,
as of 2021, there were 55 dams which served as water supply dams. In addition, there
were some 15 bund ponded storages and reservoirs augmenting water supply or river
water flow for downstream water abstraction. There were also 23 dams serving the
agricultural, and irrigation/drainage/flood mitigation functions.
Water supply and storage are significantly affected by extreme events such as floods
and dry spells. Prolonged dry spells will lead to low reservoir storages, while heavier
rainfall will result in higher reservoir water level that may affect the dam integrity,
besides the fact that the inevitable release of excess water from the reservoirs may
trigger downstream floods. According to the structural integrity assessment on the 104
dams by DID Malaysia in 2021, 40% of the dams are considered at high risk level (DID,
2022 data).
Floods (Extreme Wet)
Floods downstream of dams can occur when the water levels in the dam reach high
levels due to continuous heavy precipitation resulting in inflow rates greater than the
normal releases or extraction rate. In 2005 and 2017, downstream flood due to
increased water release after heavy rainfall occurred at the Timah Tasoh Dam, Perlis.
The town of Kangar was flooded due to the release of excess water from the dam. In
2017, the water levels of the dam were frequently above the normal levels. Under the
future scenario, Timah Tasoh Dam at Coastal 12 was projected continues to face flood
risk due to extreme wet weather throughout the century (Table 4.6). In general, there
is no increment in terms of the number of vulnerable dams at all the basins and regions
except for Batu Pahat River basin that shows an increment of two vulnerable dams by
mid-century and Coastal 5 with five vulnerable dams by late-century. Coastal 4 and
Muar are among the basins and regions with the highest number of vulnerable dams
throughout the century. Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12 show the locations of the water
supply dams and hydropower dams which have been assessed.

Dry Spells
Some of the dams were affected with repeated dry spells in the past. A prolonged dry
spell had resulted in low water levels at Sg Lebam Dam and Lok Heng Dam in Johor
towards the end of February 2019. In June-November 2021, the water level in Lebam
Dam again fell below critical level. In Melaka, the water levels at the Durian Tunggal
Dam and Jus Dam were also observed to be below the critical levels for several months
over two consecutive years (2019 and 2020). Some of the rapidly impacted dams
include the Bukit Kwong Dam (2018 and 2021) in Kelantan and the Muda Dam (2018
and 2020) in Kedah, where the water level dropped below 50%. In 2021, SPAN
identified dams at risk for water supply services based on physical dam performance,
storage level and number of treatment plant in Peninsular Malaysia. There are 6 dams
identified at high risk, 37 at medium risk and 15 at low risk (Table 4.7).

Under the future scenario, 41 water supply dams in Peninsular Malaysia were projected
to face extreme dry weather throughout the century except for the dam located at
Coastal 9, which could only face extreme dry weather by mid-century (Table 4.8). In
Sabah and Sarawak, five water supply dams from each state were also identified to
face the dry spell problems under the same timeline, except for early-century, where
there could be only four dams from Sabah and three dams from Sarawak face similar
impact.

Flood Risk Management
According to DID Malaysia, the country is exposed to approximately 144 flood events,
on an annual average. The consequence of these fluvial, monsoonal, coastal, and flash
floods is that about 33,298 km2 (10.1%) of the country land areas with 5.7 million of
people (21% of the population) are affected.
Floods
In 2022, NRES (formerly KASA) through DID Malaysia has identified 5.496 flood
hotspots over the country to alert the public who lives in these areas to potential flood
disasters (Table 4.9). With climate projections indicating that more frequent and
extreme rainfall events associated with pluvial flooding may occur in the country, the
assessments on flood impacts and vulnerability can offer suitable adaptation
measures, particularly at these identified flood hotspots.

Based on the flood areal extent projections for the 232,001 km 2 of flood prone river
basins and regions in Malaysia, around 15,158 km 2 (6.5%) of these flood prone river
basins and regions were vulnerable to floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000), as
shown in Table 4.3. These large projected flood prone areas tallied with the high
number of 5,496 flood hotspots identified throughout the entire country (Table 4.9).
Sarawak, which has the highest number of flood hotspots of 1.034, also has the largest
flood prone areas of 7,601 km2 (7.6% of the total flood prone river basins and regions)
at baseline timeline (1971-2000) and 7,864 km2 (7.8% of the total flood prone river
basins and regions) up to 2100 (Table 4.3).
Sea Level Rise
Coastal flooding due to SLR was projected to increase the vulnerability of the coastal
community. According to the impact assessment on coastal floods based on the
projected coastal inundation areas by 2100 carried out for Peninsular Malaysia and
Labuan, there is around 16.6 million of people could be affected by coastal floods due
to SLR by 2100. The number of affected populations was estimated based on an annual
population growth of 1.3% taking 2021 as baseline.
Groundwater Security
There are currently 2,017 tube wells in Malaysia. Most of the wells serve as production
wells for agricultural, domestic, industrial and mixed uses, with the rest serving as
monitoring wells. At present, the water supply from groundwater sources in Peninsular
Malaysia is estimated to be 354,420 m3 per day (0.2%), while around 10.3 million m 3
per day is from surface water. Kelantan records the highest groundwater use among
the states with 58% of its clean water supply from the aquifers.
Sea Level Rise
Continuous groundwater level and quality monitoring at some selected deep seated
tube wells is important and being conducted by the Department of Minerals and
Geosciences (DMG) Malaysia. Saltwater intrusion and coastal inundation due to SLR
is a risk to groundwater quality. In addition, over-extraction could result in increased
saline intrusion for wells located nearer to the coast.
There were 40 tube wells located in Pulau Pinang, Johor, Kelantan, Selangor,
Terengganu, Melaka, Perak, Kedah, Sabah and Sarawak projected to be vulnerable to
saltwater intrusion at current timeline (2022), as shown in Table 4.10. The preliminary
assessment indicated that 44 and 68 tube wells could be affected by saltwater intrusion
by 2050 and 2100, respectively. Among the states, Selangor (26 tube wells), Perak (11
tube wells) and Sabah (9 tube wells) show a high number of vulnerable tube wells by
2100.

Coastal Erosions
Malaysia has a coastline of over 8,840 km covering a total of 44,200 km 2 coastal zone
(13.5% of the country’s total land area). Of this coastline, 1,348 km (55.4 km under
critical erosion category, 376.1 km under significant erosion category and 916.5 km
under acceptable erosion category) covering a total of 3,693 km 2 of coastal zone is
currently exposed to potential erosion threat as reported in NC3. No substantial
increment of coastlines and coastal areas exposed to potential erosion threat was
reported since then. This could be due to the adaptation measures that had been taken.
Sea Level Rise
Coastal erosion could be worsened by SLR through inundation. SLR can result in
potentially adverse impacts of coastal flooding, accelerated coastal erosion and land
subsidence. SLR is ultimately responsible for long-term coastal erosion problems.
Based on the assessment along the 3,800 km of coastline in Peninsular Malaysia and
Federal Territory of Labuan using the Physical Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI)
adapted in the revised National Coastal Vulnerability Index (NCVI) 2021, Selangor
could be the most vulnerable state with almost 80% of its coastal areas exposed to the
threat of erosion. Other vulnerable coastal areas could also be found in Pahang, Kedah
(including Langkawi), Perak, Johor and Federal Territory of Labuan.
Under the future scenario, along the coastlines of Peninsular Malaysia, an average
increment of 0.22 m to 0.23 m in sea level was projected by 2050, further increasing to
0.67 m to 0.71 m by 2100. The coastal inundation estimated based on these SLR
projections showed that the west coast shorelines along Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang,
Perak, Selangor and west coast of Johor could be more vulnerable compared to the
east coast shorelines of Peninsular Malaysia by 2100. However, the low-lying delta
areas of the Kelantan River in the east coast is also likely to be inundated should the
SLR be 0.70 m by 2100.
In Sabah, high SLR projections along the Kudat-Sandakan coastline with magnitudes
of 0.73 m to 0.74 m by 2100 have indicated the need for further assessments of
potential coastal erosion along the coastline.
In Sarawak, the projected increment of 0.71 m to 0.72 m along the Miri-Bintulu and
Bintulu- Sejingkat coastlines by 2100 could affect the lower-lying areas around the
deltaic complexes of Sg Sarawak, affecting Petra Jaya; the Rajang delta islands, and
the smaller river mouths along the east towards Miri.
4.5.2 Adaptation Measures
Policies, Frameworks and National Plans
The National Water Policy (NWP), which is in the final stage of preparation, is one of
the key milestones towards a more sustainable and integrated management of water
resources in the country in order to face the challenges posed by climate change. This
policy will replace the National Water Resources Policy 2012. The National Climate
Change Policy 2009, which is being revised, is another policy on climate change that
aims to strengthen the institutional and implementation capacity to better harmonise
opportunities to reduce negative impacts on climate change, including water resources
in the country.
Under the 12th Malaysia Plan, the Development of the Road Map for the National
Agenda on Water Sector Transformation 2040 (WST 2040) Study has been completed
by the government as a national agenda to transform the water sector into a dynamic
& vibrant economic sector that can contribute significantly to the national GDP &
provide good quality affordable water, as well as create new job opportunities. It
ensures that impact of climate-related hazards are considered in water-related
development plans, and is continued to be fulfilled beyond 2040 through the four waves
of transformation embedded in the four Malaysian Plans from 2021 to 2040.
To support WST 2040, a Climate Change Adaptation Framework for Water Sector has
been developed by the government through NAHRIM in 2021. This framework also
aims to facilitate the formulation of sound policies and best practices that support
sustainable water management and ensure water security, especially in dealing with
climate change impacts.
Water Resources and Dam Security
The Fourth National Physical Plan (NPP4) 2020 highlighted the need for planning for
sustainable water uses in the context of climate change. Among others, this has been
done through the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) that promotes the
coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, and
the Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) that supports the relevant state water
authorities in the management of their resources.
Since the NC3, the protection of dam water catchment areas had been implemented to
ensure adequate water storage inflow into the dam reservoirs. There are around 170
permanent reserved forests already gazetted as water catchment areas in the country.
There is also a plan to gazette more of these forests in order to secure and enlarge the
reservoir storage.
The National Water Balance Management System (NAWABS), which acts as a water
management tool and uses the water balance concept to inform on water availability
for the purpose of planning and operational decision-making during droughts and dry
periods, has its first phase implemented and completed at the Kedah River basin, Muda
River basin, Bernam River basin, Melaka River basin and the Kelantan River basin in
2020 to test its efficacy. This program offers a quantitative approach to raw water
distribution and water savings efforts to improve water resources and supply services,
reservoir storage and dam security, particularly concerns during extreme dry spells
arising from climate change impact. This is supported by a national hydrological
monitoring programme and network, whereas of 2021 a total of 99 river water level,
626 rainfall stations and 455 combination (rainfall and water level) stations along the
river basins had been installed, as well as a drought information monitoring website
(InfoKemarau).
With regards to the dam safety issues due to the dam structures and extreme rainfall
at the water catchment areas, the Malaysia Dam Safety Management Guidelines
(MyDAMS) established in 2017 is being used to monitor to ensure the safety of dams.
The use of these guidelines is currently monitored by the Special Committee for Safety
Management of Dam Structures under the Ministry of Environment and Water. The
MyDAMS is an important move to enhance operator knowledge and capacity for
managing the safety of dams, especially for new dams under the changing climate
scenarios. The development of legislation on dam management and operation is the
next step in the works.
The main dam embankment and saddle dam of the Timah Tasoh Dam had been raised
under the dam upgrading projects by DID Malaysia. The upgrade will help overcome
the flood problem in the downstream area of the dam, such as at Bandar Kangar and
nearby areas, by increasing the capacity of the flood reservoir in addition to increasing
domestic and industrial water supply sources. Other dam upgrading projects include
the Bekok Dam in Batu Pahat, Johor, which is the sole water source for Batu Pahat
and Yong Peng areas. Vibrant and increasingly rapid development has caused the
demand for raw water supply to rise in these areas, especially during the dry spell
periods in the last decade. Dam upgrading works were also conducted at the Bukit
Merah Dam and the Gopeng Dam in Perak, and will be conducted for the Padang Saga
Dam in Langkawi as well.
Flood Risk Management
In Malaysia, the development of flood mitigation plans and infrastructure projects has
been one of the consistent approaches by DID Malaysia to relieve the population from
the effects of heavy rainfall and runoff. Currently, there are 76 flood mitigation projects
being implemented throughout the country, while 32 and 13 projects are respectively,
under planning and study, respectively. There are 60 hazard maps having been
developed between 2010 and 2022 at different river basins, to support these projects.
The DID Malaysia has also installed a network of telemetric rainfall and river water level
stations to monitor the rainfall and river water levels at the major river basins to help in
flood forecasting and monitoring work. Recently, this implementation has been
expanded to cover the smaller rivers as well. The National Flood Forecasting and
Warning Programme (NaFFWS) was initiated and aims to develop a system to forecast
monsoon flood, and forecast and disseminate flash flood warning, based on weather
forecast data from the Malaysia Meteorological Department (MMD).
Following the flood of debris at Jerai and Baling in Kedah, and Janda Baik in Pahang,
the sabo structure has been introduced to protect the properties, public, as well as
government assets from the impact of destruction due to debris floods. The sabo
structure is a structure designed to slow down the water current from uphill to lower
river streams, as well as to trap logs, huge rocks and debris during a water-surge
phenomenon. Apart from the pilot projects in Kedah and Pahang, a total of 52 sabo
structure construction projects will be implemented as a long-term preventive measure
in Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan,
Sabah and Sarawak.
Groundwater Security
Even though surface water is the main water source in Malaysia, groundwater is now
considered a significant supplementary water supply resource in areas with water
supply problems. Among the states, Kelantan has the highest number of production
wells since it is one of states with the highest groundwater consumption in Malaysia.
To support water supply sustainability, especially during the prolonged dry spells, DMG
has initiated a few programmes for the development of groundwater resources in some
water stressed areas in the country. By 2022, there are 224 tube wells developed
(11.1% of the tube wells in use) for this purpose.
To support water supply availability under NAWABS, DMG has a program to monitor
the groundwater levels of the tube wells located at the Kelantan River Basin, Similajau
River basin, Klang River basin, Melaka River basin and the Muda River basin. The
second phase of the monitoring program has been initiated at Padas River basin, Perak
River basin, Muar River basin and Pahang River basin. As reported in 2021, a total of
614 tube wells (30.4% of the tube wells in use) were being monitored.
Apart from ensuring groundwater availability, groundwater quality is the other area of
concern. Under the Hydrogeological Mapping and Groundwater Development Project
initiated in Kedah, a groundwater quantity and quality monitoring well would be installed
with a telemetry system to measure parameters such as conductivity, water level,
temperature, total dissolved solids and salinity. Through this project, early warning can
be given when the groundwater quality does not meet the set quality standards due to
prolonged dry spells, so that the pumping rate can be slowed down or stopped.
Coastal Erosions
To ensure sustainable coastal developments, DID Malaysia has carried out studies and
developed the Integrated Shoreline Management Plan (ISMP), which include
assessing the risks of coastal erosions. These plans are designed to support the State
development and implement adaptive measures including those arising from climate
change. At the moment, 16 ISMPs have been completed covering 12 states and 1
federal territory that represent 33% of the Malaysian coastline. Since 2020, SLR impact
has been taken into consideration in five ISMP studies.
Under the Coastal Erosion Control Programme that had started in 2016, several coastal
infrastructure projects were implemented for the conservation and repairing works
along the shorelines by DID Malaysia. As of December 2020, 26.54 km (88.5%) of the
targeted 30 km length had been achieved. Some of the important and major completed
projects include the repairing of infrastructures at 31 locations with an approximate total
length of 6.4 km along the coastlines of Perlis, Sarawak, Kelantan, Melaka and
Selangor completed in 2019. In Terengganu, an approximate 6 km of erosion control
and protection work at various locations have been implemented from 2016 to 2019.

Rice
Currently, the country has a rice self-sufficiency of 71.6%. The Ministry of Agriculture
& Agro-based Industry targeted a self-sufficiency level (SSL) of 80% by 2030 under
The Malaysia’s National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0).
In 2019, the total rice planted area in the country was 672,084 ha with a net production
of 1,516,341 metric tonnes of rice (Table 4.11 & Table 4.12). Around 77.3% of the
planted area was in Peninsular Malaysia, while 22.7% was in Sabah and Sarawak.
Kedah accounted for 31.9% of the total planted area followed by Perak (12.1%),
Kelantan (10.6%), Perlis (7.7%) and Selangor (5.4%).

In Malaysia, granaries are those with major irrigation scheme areas greater than 4,000
ha, and recognized as the main rice producing areas. The 12 main granary areas have
a total planted area of 422,066 ha with 1,211,809 metric tonnes of rice production in
2019 (Table 4.13). They are located in low-lying coastal plains and depend on irrigation
for the expectant annual double rice cropping.

Crop Yield Assessment
Assessment of the MARDI Siraj 297 crop yield in MADA based on the projected
temperature, rainfall and solar radiation was also carried out at these granaries for
early-century, mid-century and late-century. The average projected yield for the main
season could be reduced by 27.0% by late-century compared to the baseline yield of
4,933 kg per ha in 2019. The off-season yield could also be reduced by 30.1% for the
same future period.
Reduction in yield is also envisaged at KADA. Compared to the baseline yields of 4,032
kg per ha in 2019, the projected average yield for the main season and off-season could
be reduced by 39.2% and 7.2%, respectively, by late-century. For the same future
period, at the IADA Barat Laut Selangor, the main season and off-season yields were
projected reduced by 16.0% and 24.7%, respectively.
Floods
Although rice is cultivated under irrigated conditions, most of the rice varieties would
not be able to survive if exposed to prolonged total submergence. Studies by MARDI
found that rice is most susceptible to flood if it occurs during early planting but still can
recover if the flood or submergence occurs not more than 7 days during the vegetative
stage.
The parcel areas that were assessed to be prone to floods at baseline timeline (19712000) were also projected to continue to be affected by floods up to 2100 (Table 4.14).
The parcel areas in Kerian and Yan were projected to be the most vulnerable areas
with 14,275 ha and 18,075 ha, respectively, possibly facing floods up to 2100. The
other projected vulnerable areas up to 2100 were at Pasir Mas (5,633 ha), Seberang
Perai Selatan (2,624 ha) and Lipis (2,516 ha). Flood depths up to 4.51 m and 3.42 m
were projected at Lipis and Seberang Perai Selatan.

Dry Spells
A prolonged dry spell may have a direct impact on rice plant growth and production. In
early 2020, at least 36% of the total production area of KADA, MADA and IADA Penang
were affected by the prolonged dry spell, which occurred from November 2019 to
February 2020. A risk assessment of potential dry spells projected by decades up to
2050 was carried out for KADA, MADA, IADA BLS and IADA KERIAN. KADA is
anticipated to be the most affected granary with projected dry periods from mid-decade
of 2020s to late-decade of 2040s (Table 4.15). This is followed by the IADA BLS, MADA
and then IADA KERIAN. Among the projected dry periods of the four granaries, extra
attention should be given to the mid-decade of 2020s, early-decade of 2030s and latedecade of 2040s, as these are the projected dry periods at all these four granaries.

Sea Level Rise
The granaries located in the low-lying coastal plains are vulnerably exposed to SLR
and coastal inundation. Assessment of rice production areas in Kedah (MADA)
indicated that 27,417 ha or 21.2% of the areas could be inundated by seawater by 2050
(Table 4.16). The inundation could further increase to 44,204 ha (34.2%) by 2100. More
severe inundation up to 13,321 ha (62.9%) and 16,763 ha (79.2%) into the rice
cultivated areas are expected by 2050 and 2100, respectively, in Selangor IADA BLS.
Other vulnerable parcel areas are located in Perak and Pulau Pinang. Overall, the total
rice parcel areas in Peninsular Malaysia that could be affected by SLR were projected
to be 57,523 ha (17.7%) and 88,916 ha (27.4%) by 2050 and 2100, respectively.

Oil Palm
Between 2017 to 2021, the oil palm industry contributed about 37% annually to the
agriculture sector in Malaysia. In 2019, the total area planted with oil palm in Malaysia
reached 5.9 million ha, with 46.9%, 26.2% and 26.9% of the areas been located in
Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak respectively (Table 4.17). This has enabled
Malaysia to produce 19.86 million tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO) in 2019 (Table 4.18).

Climate variabilities such as El Niño and La Niña affect the physiological processes at
the early growth stages of the palm. These subsequently have a significant impact on
the yield. This was proven by the low CPO production per hectare in 2016, which was
due to the prolonged dry spell by the 2014-2016 El Niño episode. On the other hand,
in the past, the La Niña had caused severe flooding in some low-lying oil palm areas.
Although oil palm is a robust crop under extreme conditions, however, most of oil palm
growth and productivity could be affected if exposed to prolonged total submergence.
The 2010-2011 floods had affected the harvesting and collecting activities in these
areas, and had caused losses of fresh fruit bunch (FFB).
Floods
The total oil palm plantation area prone to floods in the country was projected to
increase by 1.45%, from the assessed baseline timeline (1971-2000) affected areas of
166,873 ha (6.03%) to 207,001 ha (7.48%) up to 2100 (Table 4.19). The most
vulnerable planted areas up to 2100 are located in Perak (81,817 ha), Johor (50,390
ha), Pahang (37,622 ha) and Selangor (12,445 ha).

Dry Spells
Future vulnerability and impact assessment had been carried out for the oil palm
planted areas in the four main growing states in Peninsular Malaysia. The assessment
showed that the Pahang River basin and Coastal 4 region could be the most affected
planted areas for the projected future period up to 2050 (Table 4.20). Among the
projected dry periods for the four planted areas, extra attention should be given to the
late-decades of 2030s and 2040s, as dry spells could occur simultaneously at all these
four areas. Further detailed dry spell assessments carried out for oil palm planted areas
in Johor (Coastal 4) and Pahang indicated the affected acreage to be 60.2% (456,868
ha out of 758,535 ha) and 20.5% (157,410 ha out of 768,397) of the planted areas
respectively by 2050.

Sea Level Rise
Assessment to potential coastal inundation of oil palm planted areas was carried out
for areas along the coastlines of Peninsular Malaysia. The total oil palm plantation area
in the country prone to SLR was projected to increase to 144,368 ha and 194,506 ha
by 2050 and 2100, respectively, from the projected current timeline (2022) prone area
of 71,342 ha (Table 4.21). The most vulnerable planted areas are located in Selangor
with total vulnerable areas of 62,627 ha and 78,547 ha by 2050 and 2100, respectively.
This is followed by Penang, Perak and Johor.

Rubber
In 2019, there were 1.132 million hectares of rubber planted areas in Malaysia, of which
around 68.6% was located in Peninsular Malaysia (Table 4.22). The balance was
located in Sabah and Sarawak. These planted areas produced 639,830 metric tonnes
of natural rubber production (Table 4.23). Smallholders make up of about 90% of the
total rubber planters in the country.

Floods
According to the flood risk assessment conducted for Peninsular Malaysia, the
projected planted areas prone to floods showed an increment from the baseline timeline
(1971-2000) of 33,093 ha to 39,205 ha up to 2100 (Table 4.24). The planted areas in
Perak could be the most affected with 11,674 ha and 13,717 ha at baseline timeline
(1971-2000) and up to 2100, respectively. This is followed by Kelantan (from 9,422 ha
to 10,940 ha) and Pahang (from 5,180 ha to 6,192 ha). Flood depths of more than 3 m
were identified for the affected planted areas in these two states up to 2100.

Extreme Wet
Risk assessment to potential floods due to projected extreme wet weather by 2050 was
also carried out at the Kedah, Coastal 12, Muar, Pahang and Kelantan rubber growing
regions, which account for 58.2% of the rubber cultivated areas in the country. The
planted areas in Pahang were among the most affected areas (Table 4.25). Among the
projected extreme wet periods of the five planted areas, extra attention ought to be
given to the early-decade of 2040s, as it is the projected extreme wet period at all of
these five areas. The planted areas in Pahang and Kelantan seem to be vulnerable in
2030s.

current timeline (2022) to 1,056 ha by 2050 and 2,346 ha by 2100 (Table 4.27). The
significant increase in inundated rubber planted areas by 2100 is mainly from Perak
(from the current timeline of 306 ha to 1,241 ha). Increments could also occur in Johor,
Melaka, Selangor and Terengganu.

Cocoa
In Malaysia, cocoa is the third most important commodity crop after oil palm and rubber.
In 2019, the total acreage of cocoa cultivation was 5,868 ha with a production of 1,017
metric tonnes dry cocoa beans.
The required annual rainfall for optimum cocoa yield is about 1250 to 3000 mm with
dry season not exceeding three consecutive months (rainfall not less than 100 mm per
month). Minimum temperature required for cocoa cultivation is between 19 to 21 °C,
while maximum temperature is between 30 to 32 °C. Optimum relative humidity of
cocoa cultivation ranges within 85 to 90% with the average sunshine hours from 5.0 to
5.5 hours per day. Initial research findings showed that temperatures higher than 36 oC
affected cocoa pod production. This observation was recorded at the Cocoa Research
and Development Centre (CRDC) in Jengka Pahang where recorded temperature of
37-39oC in January 2018, and more than 36oC from March to May 2018, resulted in no
pods production. A similar pattern was observed in 2019. However, long term
observation is required to assess the impact of climate change on cocoa production.
Livestock
The Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) has
projected Malaysia’s cattle population to increase by 15% and 19% and the total poultry
to increase by 8% and 11%, by 2030 and 2050 respectively, from the 2016 baseline.
Under the National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0), the government has targeted
a self-sufficiency level target of 50% for beef and 100% for fresh milk by 2025.
In general, livestock health is affected by climate change especially through extreme
weather events. General impacts observed during flooding seasons are the destruction
of farms and loss of livestock. More intense rainfall led to the emerging of water-related
diseases, with more worm infection incidence. Climate change also affects food supply
for livestock, for example poor pasture growth due to prolonged dry spells. In addition,
prolonged dry spell also affects the production, fertility and longevity of the animals.
The effects of heat stress on livestock and poultry are the reductions of productivity and
reproductive efficiency. Increased temperature and humidity can lead to faster
development of disease-causing parasites and pathogens, both directly and/or
indirectly. Climate change can also influence disease transmission by altering the
ecosystem structure and function when global mean temperatures increase and
exceed 2-3oC.
Livestock can be raised within the local diurnal temperatures fluctuating between 23°C
to 34°C and relative humidity between 55% to 98%. Local simulation studies on the
impact of temperature and humidity change utilising enclosed housing systems with
environmental control had concluded that the reduction in temperature increases the
milk yield in dairy production, while a study on local environment indicated that the
average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in beef cattle breed were
found to be better within a cooler environment.
Under extreme conditions, when Temperature-Humidity-Index (THI) reaches 93 (for
example maximum temperature reaching 35-37°C and relative humidity is at around
80%), severe heat stress would be induced thus affecting milk production of dairy cattle.
Mortality will occur when THI exceeds 100 (temperature exceeds 40°C and relative
humidity reaches 80%).
Fisheries and Aquaculture
In 2019, the fishery sector contributed approximately 12% of the agriculture sector’s
contribution to the national Gross Domestic Product (0.9% of GDP) with an annual
growth rate of 0.04%. The Per Capita Consumption (PCC) was recorded at 45.51 kg
per person per year with a Self Sufficiency Level (SSL) of 93%. A production of 1.87
million metric tonnes of food fish, 287.5 million pieces of ornamental fish, and 51.7
million bundles of aquatic plants, with a total value of RM15.26 billion, were reported in
2019.
Floods
The projected current flood prone freshwater culture system areas are not expected to
show any significant increment up to 2100, except for the freshwater culture ponds
located in Johor and Perak, and the ex-mining ponds located in Perak. The current
flood prone brackish water culture system areas did not show any change in the
projection up to 2100.
Dry Spells
Prolonged dry spells of up to two consecutive months coupled with more than 50% of
rainfall reduction were projected to occur in some particular years at Kelantan River
basin, Pahang River basin, Linggi River basin and Muar River basin by 2050. The
sudden drop of water level in rivers and lakes due to prolonged dry spells would impact
the overall production of cultured fish. This would lead to unhealthy water quality that
could predispose disease infection.
Surface Temperature
Increase in sea surface temperature may cause migration and extinction of vulnerable
aquatic species and changes in aquatic biodiversity due to more frequent occurrence
of algal blooming, damage to coral reefs and physiological changes in aquatic.
Concurrently, increase in inland temperatures may also bring changes to the
limnological stratification and reduce primary productivity and fish food supply.
Sea Level Rise
One of the impacts of SLR and consequential coastal inundation will be damages to
fishing infrastructures and aquaculture areas, including loss of mangrove swamps and
shellfish farming areas. Extreme water salinity due to inland salt water intrusion induces
stress on the pond’s ecosystem and thus reduce freshwater aquaculture. Changes in
ocean currents and higher seawater level due to global warming will bring changes in
coral reefs and mangroves area, which will reduce marine (capture fish) and
aquaculture productions.
Under the future scenario, the current freshwater culture ponds and ex-mining pools in
Perak are projected to be vulnerable to SLR by 2050. However, no further significant
increment of SLR prone areas is expected in this state by 2100. The culture ponds in
Johor, Kedah and Selangor were projected to have higher risk exposure to SLR by
2100.
Among the brackishwater culture systems, hatcheries and ponds were projected more
prone to SLR by 2050 and 2100. Hatcheries in Terengganu show an increasing trend
in their flood prone areas throughout the century. The increment of SLR prone pond
areas by 2100 are mainly at the ponds in Negeri Sembilan, Sabah and Sarawak.
4.6.2 Adaptation Measures
The National Agricommodity Policy (DAKN) 2021-2030, which was launched in 2022,
is a continuation of the National Commodity Policy (DKN) 2011-2020. It is part of the
Malaysian’s Government efforts to drive the development of the agri-commodity sector
in a more sustainable, competitive and market-oriented manner. The DAKN 2021-2030
will be used as a reference for the country's commodity industry in terms of
environment, social and governance (ESG) as well as towards achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDG 2030). Meanwhile, The Malaysia’s
National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0) has been formulated with the vision of
developing a sustainable, resilient, and technology-based agro-food sector in driving
economic growth, improving people’s well-being as well as prioritising food security and
nutrition, in line with the global goals as aspired in Sustainable Development Goals
2030 (SDG 2030).
Rice
Adaptation measures for a cropping system requires proper planning. Several
measures have been taken to improve water resources for irrigation in the granary
areas during dry seasons, and proper field drainage during the wetter seasons. These
measures include scheduled release of water from dams, re-use of drainage water
using water pumps, mobilization of water pumps, water monitoring using telemetry
systems and cloud seeding.
In KADA, three additional screw water pumps have been installed to cater for sufficient
irrigation water supply during dry spell conditions. In the event of excess water from
rain, proper drainage channels can be designed to divert water from the areas. In
tandem, the development of the submergence-tolerant rice varieties is also being
conducted by MARDI in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO).
In 2019, a pilot study on a new water management technique that helps to improve
water use efficiency in irrigated fields through the modified alternate wetting and drying
technique was carried out in Kampung Selarong, Kedah. The technique helps to save
up to 35% of water usage in rice production system without affecting the yield (Aziz et
al., 2020).
The identification of the Malaysian rice germplasm with drought, salinity and
submergence tolerance that provide a high yield potential under extreme weather
conditions is being conducted by MARDI. The development of a new drought-tolerant
rice variety that carries drought-tolerant QTL (qDTYs) genes is currently being
undertaken. The new variety with integrated drought-tolerant genes is expected to
produce high-yielding grain similar to the MARDI Siraj 297. The development of the
salinity-resistant rice varieties as adaptation measure for saltwater intrusion by MARDI
is still at an early stage. Screening of the most advanced potential varieties below
salinity stress is being implemented.
Livestock
Climate change impact to livestock was first loosely addressed by the Malaysia’s
Livestock Breeding Policies (2013). The National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0)
has outlined strategies to enhance genetic value of livestock through the application of
scientific knowledge and technology, towards moving up the value chain in sustainable
animal production in this changing climate.
Indigenous breeds such as the Kedah-Kelantan cattle, Brahman and Katjang goat were
identified for better adaptation towards heat stress and tropical diseases. The Katjang
goat through crossbreeding with the Boer goat, had resulted in the Boer-Katjang goat
with its higher growth performance.
In 2021, several projects were undertaken to improve local dairy productivity with both
imported and locally available dairy cattle breed. The imported breed includes the
Jersey-Friesian cattle from Australia. Another dairy cattle breed, the Mafriwal,
developed by crossbreeding of Sahiwal and Friesian breeds is. This breed is expected
to increase its milk production and population under a National Dairy Plan (2021-2025).
Other programmes developed to increase the productivity include the development of
SOP for fertility improvement of dairy goats, feed formulation for optimum milk yield
production, as well as economic analysis for dairy goat production. MARDI has
introduced a local chicken breed known as the Ayam Saga to meet the demand for
chicken meat and egg supply. Local research institutions are moving towards this
aspect especially in evaluating locally available breeds that are heat and disease
tolerant.
Fisheries and Aquaculture
A program called myKomuniti Perikanan (myKP) is being implemented by the
Department of Fishery (DoF) Malaysia to help the marine and inland fishermen with
various activities in the fisheries value chains. The program also acts as the platform
to communicate about risks related to climate change. Some other measures such as
Fishing Site Identification (FSI) system and conservation of fishing zones continue to
be implemented. Broodstock development programs and species prioritisation for
aquaculture are also being implemented to produce new breeds in order to increase
the fish production.
The aquacultural production areas that are potentially affected by rising sea surface
temperature and SLR in the not-too-distant future are being identified using the
geographic information system (GIS) initiatives. Aquaculture producers are also
encouraged to adopt the latest technologies such as indoor and controlled farming, the
Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS), the Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture
(IMTA) and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to optimize production in the face of
climate changes.
Oil Palm
The Revised Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Standards is the current initiative
by the government to promote sustainability in the palm oil industry. Climate change
elements are also included in this Standard. This includes water management system,
which depends on the soil type and topographic condition. Information on pest and
disease had also been extended through The SawitSecure apps.
More research on impact of climate change to the oil palm crop productivity and
diseases, such as the adoption of Ganoderma disease resistant palms, had been
initiated by MPOB. Crop Model simulations to study the impact of climate change on
oil palm productivity have also been carried out regularly. Additionally, research to
identify and producing new planting materials with high Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
traits, drought and floods resistance, and other desirable important attributes that make
them resilient to climate change as well as being suited to different agro-ecological
regions, have also been initiated by the MPOB.
Rubber
A breeding and selection programme to develop clones with climate-resistant traits
(yield and growth performance), that is concurrently resistant to Pestalotiopsis leaf fall
disease and environmental stresses such as drought and flooding, has been initiated
by The Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB). A gravimetric phenotyping system to screen
and evaluate the developed drought tolerant clones by MRB is at the development
stage. The evaluation is based on the phenotypic and water use efficiency (WUE)
variation of the rubber clone in dry soils.
In line with technological advancement, a geospatial system that integrates databases
for planted rubber regions, soil type, planted clones, rubber disease distribution, and
agro-climatic conditions, is utilised to identify the planting areas favourable for rubber.
An integration of simulation models known as the RRIM EcoSmart System, is being
used to forecast the effects of climate change on rubber cropping regions.
Cocoa
A study on the identification of drought and flood tolerant cocoa clones commenced in
late 2015 is still ongoing. Initial assessment on 24 commercial cocoa clones showed
that most of the clones have tolerant traits against flood and drought conditions.
Adaptation of cocoa to extreme dry weather using fertigation systems was initiated in
2018. Drip fertigation systems were installed at the CRDC Bagan Datuk Perak and at
the CRDC Jengka Pahang, to assess the efficiency of field fertigation in increasing
cocoa productivity, regardless of long drought period. It was found that the higher
amount of fertilizers applied, the higher pod count was recorded. The efficiency of the
system is being assessed continuously, and data has been collected since 2018.
Stress tolerance of cocoa trees subjected to smart water gel was investigated on the 6
months old hybrid cocoa trees. The study found that cocoa trees protected with shade
and water gel had better growth, and higher chlorophyll content, leaf area and more
green leaves. Thus, smart water gel can be introduced to the farmers during
transplanting, especially during the dry and hot weather periods, to achieve a higher
survival rate after planting.

Forestry and Biodiversity
4.7.1 Impact and Vulnerability
Forestry
There were 18.135 million hectares of forest areas (54.9% of the total land area) in
Malaysia in 2019. The forest is generally divided into three categories according to the
degree of protection and land use classification, namely; (i) Permanent Reserved
Forest / Forest Reserved / Permanent Forest Estate (10.684 million ha), (ii) Protected
Areas / Totally Protected Areas (3.360 million ha), and (iii) State Land Forest (4.091
million ha).
Permanent Reserved Forest is managed sustainably following Malaysia’s criteria and
indicators for sustainable forest management for natural forest and plantation forest. In
considering climate change impact on the forest ecosystems of the Permanent
Reserved Forest, three forest types namely; (a) the Inland Forests (9.682 million ha),
(b) Peat Swamp Forests (0.417 million ha) and, (c) Mangrove Forests (0.334 million
ha), were assessed in this report.
Dry Spells
Forest fires are exacerbated by climate change. In Malaysia, forest fire incidences
increased during prolonged dry periods. Peatland is predisposed to forest fire due to
the drying of the peat, although it may also occur in the inland forest. Usually fires from
surrounding degraded area would spread into the forest. The potential for higher
incidences of forest fire occurrence was assessed based on the likelihood of projected
prolonged dry spells lasting at least four months or more.
A total of 58 peat swamp forest reserves (20 in Peninsular Malaysia, 25 in Sabah and
13 in Sarawak) was assessed for their vulnerabilities to such prolonged dry spells. The
assessments showed that extra attention needs to be given to the peat swamp forest
reserves in Peninsular Malaysia in the mid-century and late-century (Table 4.28). In
Sabah, extra caution needs to be taken in the early-century, specifically in the Kulamba
Wildlife and Kulamba Wildlife Reserve (Extension) where seven consecutive extreme
dry months was projected. In Sarawak, the similar situation was projected for earlycentury and mid-century

The impact of SLR on mangrove forest, inland forest and peat swamp forest have been
assessed for the coastlines and coastal areas of Malaysia. Under the future scenario,
an area of 40,749 ha of mangrove forest reserves in Peninsular Malaysia were
projected to be affected by 2050 (Table 4.29). There were 283 ha of peat swamp forest
and 1,283 ha of inland forest reserve areas projected to face the similar situation by
the same timeline.

Mangrove forest could become more vulnerable with 47,913 ha estimated being
affected by 2100 (Table 4.29). The affected mangrove forests were projected to be in
Perak (25,863 ha), Johor (10,993 ha), Selangor (6,732 ha), Kedah (3,564 ha), Pahang
(261 ha), Pulau Pinang (258 ha), Terengganu (94 ha), Melaka (84 ha) and Negeri
Sembilan (63 ha). By 2100, the affected inland forest was projected to be in Kedah
(993 ha), Perak (688 ha), Terengganu (65 ha), Perlis (16 ha) and Melaka (0.6 ha), with
a total of 1,763 ha. A total of 563 ha of peat swamp forest could be inundated in Pahang
(211 ha), Selangor (69 ha), Johor (79 ha) and Terengganu (204 ha).
In Sabah, a total mangrove forest reserve of 200,919 ha was projected to be affected
by 2050 (Table 4.29). About 901 ha of peat swamp forest and 61,015 ha of inland forest
reserve areas were projected to face the similar problem under the same timeline. All
types of forest in Sabah could be more vulnerable by 2100 with 226,589 ha of mangrove
forest, 1,982 ha of peat swamp forest and 72,154 ha of inland forest were projected to
be affected by SLR.
In Sarawak, a total of 16,679 ha mangrove forest, 5,974 ha of peat swamps and 1,034
ha of secondary forests were projected to be affected by SLR inundation by 2050. By
2100, the affected mangrove forest of 34,725 ha could be double that of 2050, while
the affected peat swamp forest and secondary forest of 19,696 ha and 3,736 ha,
respectively, could amount to triple that of 2050.
Biodiversity
Malaysia is one of the megadiverse countries, where most of biodiversity is found in
the forest and marine ecosystems. Details of the Malaysian biodiversity information are
available in the 6th National Report of Malaysia to the Convention on Biodiversity.
The direct impact of climate change on biodiversity and the ecosystem health is still
unclear. Long term ecological plots at the Pasoh and Lambir Forest Reserves have yet
to demonstrate species displacement due to climate change. However, one well
documented example is the migration of various species of moths native to Mount
Kinabalu uphill, exactly as would be expected if they are following temperature zones
that are also migrating uphill as a consequence of global warming.
In addition, fragmentation of the forest results in the loss of ecological connectivity,
which affects animal and plant populations, and overtime this could lead to increased
vulnerability to climate change. Many forest birds, especially those that inhabit the
understorey, do not readily fly over into open areas. Many fish and other aquatic
species cannot survive in rivers that flow through degraded areas. Thus, many animals
are trapped in areas that are too small to provide the necessary resources for their
survival. Even if they do survive, over the longer term, they face genetic isolation that
causes extinctions of local populations. This also applies to plants in as much as plants
“move” via pollen and seed distribution.
Terrestrial Fauna
Fauna responds to climate change by migration or adaptation. The migrations usually
follow an animal's preferred temperature, elevation, soil and availability of food source,
while adaptation can be either genetic or phenological.
Birds
In Malaysia, birds are categorised into residential birds and migratory birds. They can
be found in different ecosystems ranging from forests, inland waters, coastal and
marine areas, agricultural lands, to urban, that are geographically dispersed within the
three regions of Malaysia. Bako-Buntal Bay, Sarawak, is an important habitat for
migratory waterbirds. This peat swamp area is recognized as a flyaway site under the
East Asian-Australasian Flyaway Partnership.
Temperature is a critical climate parameter for mountain or highland birds, while
freshwater is vital for the survival of stressed-out migratory waterbirds. More rainfall
would create more conducive habitats for waterbirds through more wetland formations.
On the other hand, prolonged dry spells would create dry forest conditions that will be
vulnerable to wildfires resulting in habitat loss and food scarcity for mountain or
highland birds.
Changes in bird migratory patterns due to climate change impact is difficult to establish.
Extreme weather patterns usually have negative impacts on reproduction. Population
crashes have been reported and linked to weather anomalies in the past. In general,
adaptive capacity decreases most in vulnerable bird categories, especially the
migratory birds.
Orang Utan
The primary habitat of the Orang Utan is the lowland old-growth and mosaic forest
below 500m above sea level. However, lower density of Orang Utans can also be found
in the higher up areas as high as 1,500m above sea level.
Climatic change and human inflicted pressures have resulted in significant reductions
in the range and numbers of Orang Utan during the recent historic past. A recent
analysis indicated that between 20,000 and 25,000 Orang Utan are likely to be found
concentrated in small forest patches within agricultural landscapes across the island.
Elephant
In Malaysia, elephants are found in Peninsular Malaysia and in Sabah. According to
the estimation by The Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) Peninsular
Malaysia conducted in 2011, there were 1,223 to 1,677 Asian elephants (Elephas
maximus) scattered in seven states, namely Kedah, Perak, Pahang, Terengganu,
Kelantan, Johor, and Negeri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia (Salman et al., 2011).
They are also distributed within the primary habitat identified as Managed Elephant
Ranges (MERs) in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, the Taman Negara Forest
Complex, and the Endau-Rompin Forest Complex (DWNP, 2013), respectively in the
north, central and southern regions of the peninsular.
In Sabah, the Bornean pygmy elephants, which favour flat lands, floodplains and
valleys, are found in the north-eastern part of the State. A reduction of at least 60% of
population was reported in 2014 due to conversion of low-lying forests in the State to
other types of land uses, primarily for agriculture. Recently, it was estimated that the
remaining numbers have dwindled down to not more than 1,000 to 1,500 elephants,
roaming across the state. The major MERs in Sabah include the lower reaches of the
Kinabatangan River basin, Tabin and Central Sabah.
Tiger
Malaysia is one of the 13 nations where tigers still survive in the wild. According to The
First National Tiger Survey conducted between 2016 and 2020 by PERHILITAN
Malaysia, a total of 44,000 km2 of the Central Forest Spine (CFS) area in Peninsular
Malaysia was considered as tiger habitats, and these include all forest types from the
lowland forest to the mountain forest. There are four Malayan tiger forest landscapes
in the country having been recognised in the survey, which lie across the Ulu MudaBintang Hijau Complex, Titiwangsa Main Range, Taman Negara National Park and the
Endau-Rompin Complex. The biggest threat that the Malayan tiger faces is the illegal
hunting, while habitat loss is another major threat. A few years back, the Malayan tiger
was infected by the Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), of which unfortunately, there is yet
a medicine for cure.
Currently, there are no studies specifically looking into the impact of climate change on
the Malayan tiger. However, climate change may have a substantial undeviating
influence on this critically endangered terrestrial animal, and pushing them to the brink
of extinction. This, definitely can be accelerated by deforestation or the unsustainable
land use development that often result in bringing more severe floods and landslide
affecting the habitats. Unexpected forest fires due to prolonged dry spells could also
threaten their food sources.
Sambar Deer
Several studies indicated that the population of sambar deer (Rusa unicolour) showed
a decreasing trend. One of the efforts to increase the population of sambar deer in
Peninsular Malaysia is through a breeding program at the Wildlife Conservation Centre
(WCC) in Perak and Kelantan.
Marine Ecosystem
Coral Reefs
Climate change is a major threat to coral loss. An increase in sea water temperatures
of 1 to 2°C above the normal temperature level of 27 oC for a prolonged period would
reduce coral cover through coral bleaching. Ocean warming can also indirectly kill
corals through creating a more favourable sea environment for increasing the incidence
and propagation of coral diseases.
The Malaysia Annual Coral Reefs Health Survey 2021 using the Reef Check Survey
works in collaboration with Reef Check Malaysia showed a “fair” level (25% - 50%) of
live coral cover of 44.26% on average (Figure 4.13 & Figure 4.14). This improvement
could be at least partly due to the huge reduction in tourist visitors (both international
and domestic) to coral reefs, specifically during the pandemic movement control
operations in 2020 and 2021. However, further monitoring is required to confirm this
observation which, if supported by data, may suggest that periodic site closures should
be seriously considered as a management improvement recovery measure for the
future.

Marine Turtles
Malaysia is home to four of the extant species of marine turtles namely; the leatherback,
green, hawksbill and olive ridley species. The recorded total number of turtle landings
in Peninsular Malaysia from 2011 until 2020 is shown in Figure 4.15, while Table 4.30

In Sabah, Marine Parks including the Tunku Abdul Rahman Park, Turtle Island Park,
and the Sipadan Island Park are the major nesting sites in this region. According to the
Sabah Parks and Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) joint studies, some of these sites,
especially in the Turtle Island Park, are affected by coastal erosion. Decline of hawksbill
turtles had been observed in the Turtle Island Park due to the loss of the nesting beach
at Gulisaan, which had suffered severe beach erosions. Currently, these parks are
being monitored by the Sabah Parks and UMS under their coastal erosion
hydrodynamics studies. Researches on impact of SLR on coastal erosion and marine
mammals need to be conducted and advised.
Marine Mammals
Twenty-seven species of marine mammals are confirmed to be found in the waters
surrounding Malaysia (Jaaman, 2006; Ponnampalam, 2012). A study of marine
mammals at Penang Island by Rajamani et al. (2018) showed that four species of
dolphin and porpoise, regularly appear within the coastal waters. However, Penang
Island is a rapidly growing zone of economic importance, with massive infrastructure
expansion and extensive coastal zone development and reclamation already
underway. Thus, it is important to establish a marine mammal management plan for
these waters to ensure their survival.
In Sabah, the Tun Mustapha Park (TMP) is generally specified as being medium in
exposure to the impacts of SLR and waves during typhoons and monsoons based on
a climate change vulnerability assessment. However, the medium exposure impacts
could be due to the geographical location of TMP in the southern part of the typhoon
belt of the Philippines and the assessment sites were located in the most sheltered
areas of the islands. Therefore, further researches on impact of SLR on the marine
mammals at TMP need to be conducted and advised.
4.7.2 Adaptation Measures
Forestry and Biodiversity
Extreme weather could affect forest resilience in the long term. For example, the 1997–
1998 El Niño drought, increased tree mortality and hence reduced the net productivity
of the forests. Additionally, a study in Borneo has shown that fragmentation reduced
the forest sink and turned many edge-affected forests into a carbon source. Some
measures undertaken to conserve and protect the natural ecosystem are as follows:
● Two programmes, Central Forest Spine (CFS) and Heart of Borneo (HoB) are
implemented to increase resilience including to climate change of natural
ecosystems. One of the strategies is to establish connectivity and corridors
between forests and other ecological areas. To date, a total of 37,614 ha have
been gazetted as ecological corridor under the CFS. Under the HoB, corridors
between Kinabalu ECOLINC, Sipitang – Ulu Padas, Ulu Segama – Malua,
Danum-Maliau-Imbak and Kinabatangan Corridor of Life in Sabah are being
implemented. Sarawak will develop action plans for their Mulu- Pulong Tau
ecological linkage. This measure will increase the adaptive capacity of these
ecosystems to climate change.
● Malaysia plans to increase land surface and inland waters as protected areas or
other effective area-based conservation measures by 20%. This will also
integrate the network of Community Conserved Areas (CCA) across landscapes
and seascapes, and recognise these CCAs as an integral part of the nation’s
protected area network.
● As part of forest management, a requirement of buffer strips for permanent
streams and rivers in Inland Forest and Peat Swamp Forest of at least 5 m in
width on both sides of the stream or river and felling of trees is prohibited.
● Forest plantation design and layout shall promote the protection, restoration and
conservation of natural forests. Where the forest plantation is located adjacent
to an environmentally sensitive area, an adequate buffer zone shall be
established and maintained.
The forest fire prevention involves agencies such as the Fire and Rescue Department,
Forestry Department and the Department of Environment. Relevant measures are
being undertaken by these agencies to address the issue. The State Forestry
Departments have developed a plan on the prevention and control of fires within the
natural and plantation forests. Each state also has assigned a forestry officer to handle
all matters pertaining to forest fires. Some of the adaptation measures put in place
include infrastructure developed under the 11th Malaysia Plan including installation of
tube wells and checked dams. For example, a monitoring tower and reservoir for
providing water for use during fire outbreaks were constructed in Kuala Langat Selatan
Forest Reserve, Selangor. In Sabah, monitoring of hotspots and Fire Weather Index
(FWI) as well as ground-aerial surveillance had been put in place as measures for early
forest fires detection. The Forestry Department’s Fire Crew will be activated when FWI
rating is medium or high. Canal blocking activities are also undertaken as part of rewetting the drained peatlands.
In addition, in 2010, the Federal Government through the Forestry Department
Peninsular Malaysia has embarked on a Tree-Planting Program involving communities
as part of the national agenda for addressing climate change and improving the quality
of people’s lives. Furthermore, ‘The Greening Malaysia Programme’ through ‘The 100
million Tree-Planting Campaign’ has been launched in January 2021. The campaign
was launched simultaneously at the states level. Under this campaign, by the end of
2025, some 100 million trees are expected to be planted throughout Malaysia. As of
August 2022, a total of 37,128,111 trees have been planted in the country (Table 4.31).
The replanting programme is carried out with help from Community-Based
Organizations (CBO), NGOs and private sectors.

The implementation of protection or restoration of mangroves programme can offer
increased protection of coastal areas to SLR and extreme weather events, as well as
help regulate flow in watersheds. In 2005, Malaysia launched the ‘Tree Planting
Programme with Mangrove and Other Suitable Species along the National Coastlines’
as part of mangrove forest conservation and environmental protection activities in
response to the tsunami disaster of 2004. As of 2021, through an integrated approach
and involvement of all state governments, private sectors, NGOs, students and local
communities, Malaysia had successfully planted 7.1 million mangrove seedlings and
other suitable tree species encompassing more than 3,000 hectares of coastal area
throughout the country’s coastlines (Table 4.32).

Peat fires pose a significant threat to the livelihood of local communities, as well as
being a health hazard. The Forestry Department Peninsular Malaysia has taken actions
to construct infrastructures to prevent forest fire especially in peat swamps. These
include checked dam, tube wells, reservoir pool, watch tower, clay dyke and
piezometer. In 2021, the Department of Mineral and Geoscience installed two tube
wells at Kuala Langat Forest Reserve in Selangor under the Peat Fire Prevention and
Monitoring Program to help in peat fires prevention. In Sabah, Forest Fire Early
Detection Measures, which include monitoring hotspots and Fire Weather Index, was
established as forest fire management preparedness.
Marine Ecosystem
It is targeted to have 10% of the coastal and marine territories will be conserved as
marine protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures. With this
achievement, the marine ecosystem would be more resilient towards the impacts of the
changing climate.
Coral Reefs
After the event of mass coral bleaching in 2010 and the ever exposed vulnerability of
the marine environment due to climate change, the Department of Fisheries Malaysia
started to look at ways to address the future of coral reefs through coral reef restoration.
The three pillars to build the reef resilience namely water quality, herbivory and physical
impacts, have to be addressed on a location-by-location basis to ensure that short-term
impacts are being dealt with, and at the same time looking at building long-term reef
resilience. A real-time marine park water quality monitoring system that allows real time
water quality monitoring and provides a graphical format to view the historical logged
data was therefore developed by the Department of Fisheries Malaysia for the building
reef resilience initiative in Malaysia’s water.
Marine Turtles
For Sabah’s turtle conservation, Sabah Parks have increased the size of the hatchery
in Sipadan Island Park, and partly shaded all the hatcheries to reduce the temperature
in the hatcheries during incubation to produce a balanced sex ratio of hatchlings
Marine Mammals
In order to enhance the marine mammal habitat ecosystems, high-vulnerability sites
such as in Tun Mustapha Park, Sabah, require immediate adaptation measures to
protect the marine mammals living in these areas. An ecosystem-based approach to
protect and restore existing coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests for
example in Tiga Island is needed. Establishment of ex situ conservation areas as
sanctuary to conserve the marine mammals would be necessary.
4.8
Cities, Built Environment and Infrastructures
4.8.1 Impact and Vulnerability
Cities
In Malaysia, a town or city is defined as one where its gazetted area together with that
identified as potential development areas within its boundary, has a total population of
10,000 people or more and of which, at least 60% of its inhabitants are aged 15 years
and above and, who are involved with non-agriculture activities. The rate of township
development in Peninsular Malaysia had increased from 71% to 75.6% throughout the
2010-2018 period. As of 2022, it has been recognised that there are 281 towns and
cities, and these are classified into five hierarchical categories, namely the global city,
regional city, state city, major town and the local town.
Floods
In Peninsular Malaysia, it is quite frequent to have the typical evening high intense
concentrated downpours, which tend to result in flash floods in the towns and cities at
west coast; whilst, over at the east coast, monsoon floods brought by the north-east
monsoon are the more common flood events, as had occurred in 2021.
Based on the hydroclimate projection and assessment, there are 86 towns and cities
located over all the states of Peninsular Malaysia, except for Perlis, could be prone to
floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000), and the number was projected to increase to
96 up to 2100 (Table 4.33). This includes the capital city of Kuala Lumpur for both
timelines. Johor, Kelantan, Pahang, Kedah, Perak and Selangor were among the states
projected to have the highest number of flood vulnerable towns and cities.

Dry Spells
The impact due to dry spells incidents are the drying up of water supply reservoirs
resulting in water supply crisis in the towns and cities. Malaysia had in previous years
experienced dry spells over a number of times. The most severe drought was recorded
in 1998, which in particular, had affected 1.8 million residents in southern areas of
Kuala Lumpur, bringing in some periods of disrupted water supply. Some episodes of
drought had happened in the country since then.
Under the future scenario, 25 towns and cities in Malaysia were projected to face
extreme dry weather in the early-century (Table 4.34). They are mainly located in
Melaka, followed by Johor, Sabah and Negeri Sembilan. Further into mid-century and
late-century, there were 57 and 68 towns and cities, respectively, projected to face the
similar situation. These include the towns and cities located in Selangor, the capital city
of Kuala Lumpur and the administrative city of Putrajaya. Among the states, Melaka,
Selangor and Johor could have the highest numbers of vulnerable towns and cities.
There was no significant extreme dry weather projected at any town and city located in
Sarawak throughout the whole century.

According to the SLR estimated along the Peninsular Malaysia coastlines, there were
111 towns and cities projected to be prone to SLR inundation at current timeline (2022)
(Table 4.35). These towns and cities are located along the coastal areas of all the states
with the majority found in Pulau Pinang, Selangor, Johor, Kedah, Melaka and
Terengganu. There was no projected increase in the number of towns and cities by
2050. However, it is estimated that an additional five towns and cities could be affected
by 2100.

Built Environment
In Malaysia, built environment lands are used for housing development, commercial
development, industrial development, infrastructures and utilities, institutions and social
facilities, transportation, and rest and recreational activities, along with vacant/open
land for future uses. In Peninsular Malaysia, the built environment lands cover about
1,282,166.35 ha (9.71%) of the total land in the peninsular (Table 4.36).

Floods
The change in land use to accommodate the built environment has inevitably resulted
in the reduction of infiltration water into the soil, which would then increase the surface
water runoff leading to higher flows into drains during periods of high intensity rain and
flash floods can occur. There were 75,927 ha (5.92%) of the built environmental areas
in Peninsular Malaysia projected to be prone to floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000).
An increment of 20,636 ha (27.18%) was projected up to 2100.
Dry Spells
Although there is no direct effect of dry spells on the built environment, prolonged dry
spells tend to result in open land and forest fires, and create islands of haze
overhanging the environment. Based on the projected future scenario, it is estimated
that 51,373 ha or 4.01% of built environment areas in Malaysia could face dry spells in
early-century. This could increase to 203,024 ha (+295.20%) by mid-century, and
further increase to 229,140 ha (+346.03%) by late-century.
Sea Level Rise
At current timeline (2022), about 50,200 ha (3.92%) of built environment in Peninsular
Malaysia was assessed to be affected by SLR. Under the future scenario, the affected
area was projected to increase to 65,917 ha (+31.31%) by 2050 and 99,774 ha
(+98.75%) by 2100.
Roads
Roads in Peninsular Malaysia are generally categorized into federal roads, state roads
and expressways. In 2020, the total road length was 267,046 km, which had comprised
of approximately 92.5% of state roads, 7.5% of federal roads and expressways, under
the jurisdiction of Ministry of Public Works. In Sabah and Sarawak, the Pan Borneo
Highway with a total length of 2,083 km is a road network on Borneo Island connecting
these two Malaysian states.
Floods
Floods on roads and highways can cause public distress and asset damages in the
affected areas. There were 1,111 km of roads and highways projected prone to floods,
including the Pan Borneo Highway in Sabah and Sarawak, at baseline timeline (19712000), as shown in Table 4.37. The affected length was projected to increase to 1,325
km up to 2100. Highways in Peninsular Malaysia were projected to be more vulnerable
to climate change with an additional 144 km section up to 2100.

Rails
The major railway lines in Peninsular Malaysia service are 1,677 km in length and
consist of two major lines, one running along the entire west coast from north to south
and is 1,151 km in length. The other line of length 526 km, starts at Gemas in the
central point of the west coast line and head north-east ward ending at Tumpat in
Kelantan. The other rail services are those inter-city lines, the KL-KLIA express rail,
and the KL city metro lines. The rails are entirely electrified rail services. Currently
under construction is the East Coast Railway Line.
Floods
According to Malayan Railways Limited (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad, KTMB),
certain sections of their route lines are prone to and are often affected by flash floods.
Records of KTMB rail track affected by floods in the years 2020-2021 are summarized
in Table 4.40. In December 2021, the railway tracks between the Subang Jaya and
Batu Tiga KTM stations was disrupted by floods. Intercity services towards the east
coast of Peninsular Malaysia are also disrupted as a result of flooding. About 300 km
length of track line located on the east coast between Kuala Lipis to Tumpat is at high
risks of flooding during north-east monsoon heavy rain episodes.

section length located in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor,
Pulau Pinang, Perak and Kuala Lumpur were projected to be prone to floods up to
2100 (Table 4.41). The railways and stations in Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Selangor
and Kuala Lumpur are among the most vulnerable infrastructures to the floods.

effects of SLR (Table 4.42). The affected length is expected to remain the same for all
those states by 2050 and by 2100, except for the railway in Pulau Pinang. The affected
length of railway in Pulau Pinang was projected to increase from the current timeline
(2022) of 37.7 km to 38.5 km (+2.2%) by 2050 and 61.1 km (+62.1%) by 2100.

Ports and Jetties
In Malaysia, ports are categorized into sea port and dry/inland port. There are 28 ports
established in Malaysia, which include seven national ports (Klang Port, Pulau Pinang
Port, Johor Port at Pasir Gudang, Tanjung Pelepas Port, Kuantan Port, Kemaman Port
and Bintulu Port) and 21 State ports (9 of the state ports are located in Peninsular
Malaysia, while 4 are located in Sarawak and 8 in Sabah). There are also 35
jetties/ferry terminals to provide services for local passenger transport and vehicle
transfers distributed over the states.
Dry Spells
Ships calling at ports could be affected by haze due to prolonged dry spells. There are
however, no current local dry spells direct impact onto ports and jetties/ferry terminals
reported. However though, lengthy dry spells that are prolonged in future may cause
haze to form, and this phenomenon can disturb the operations at the ports and
jetties/ferry terminals. Under the future scenario, five ports and jetties/ferry terminals
were projected to be prone to dry spells by early-century, and the number is expected
to increase to 12 and 13 ports and jetties/ferry terminals by mid-century and latecentury, respectively (Table 4.43).

However, by 2100, an additional 11 ports and jetties/ferry terminals, respectively
located at Kelantan, Perak, Pulau Pinang, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak, could be
affected by SLR. Sabah shows a significant increment of four ports and jetties/ferry

Airports
There are six international airports, 16 domestic airports and 18 Flight Fields (Short
Take-off and Landing, STOLport) in Malaysia. Under the current situation, continuous
rainfall sometimes caused slight flash floods at the arrival hall of the Penang
International Airport (PIA). In Sarawak, the Lawas STOLport had previously
experienced a few flood incidents in 2020-2022, with the flooded depth as high as one
meter. In 2010, the Sultan Abdul Halim Airport in Kedah was closed after floodwaters
seeped onto parts of the 2,745 m long runway. The operations at these airports were
temporarily stopped for a few days due to the serious flooding at the runaway.
Floods
Majority of the airports in Sabah and Sarawak were projected to face flooding
problems at baseline timeline (1971-2000) and up to 2100. These include five airports
in Sabah and five airports in Sarawak. In Peninsular Malaysia, the airports in Perak
and Kedah were projected to be flood prone at both timelines.
Dry Spells
Visibility for flights at the airports are significantly affected and flights are disrupted
during the haze occurrences following prolonged dry spell periods. In Malaysia, the
operations of 14 airports were reported to be disrupted during the haze phenomenon
in 2015. However, the impact of the projected future local dry spells onto the
infrastructures at the airport are not expected to be significant.
Under the future scenario, the airport in Melaka together with an airport in Sabah were
projected to face dry spell impacts in some particular extreme dry years throughout
the whole century. Similar impact was also projected for another airport in Sabah but
only in the early-century and late-century. In addition, the airport in Johor was
projected to be prone to dry spell in mid-century only, while an airport in Selangor was
projected to be prone to dry spell in late-century only.
Sea Level Rise
The Penang International Airport was projected to face SLR inundation by 2050 and
2100. There are, however, no other airports or STOLports that were projected to be
affected by SLR throughout the century.
Solid Waste Facilities
As of 2021, landfills, incinerator and transfer stations, are the means of solid waste
disposal in the country. There are approximately 21 sanitary landfills, 114 non-sanitary
landfills, four inert waste landfills, four incinerators and five transfer stations currently
in use in the country.
Floods
Some solid waste disposal sites are vulnerable to floods. Based on the flood areal
extent maps, four of the solid waste disposal sites located in Pahang, Selangor and
Perak were projected to be prone to floods up to 2100.
Dry Spells
Although dry spells are expected not to seriously jeopardise the solid waste
infrastructures, nevertheless, the hot seasons that are prolonged too much can
become a source of fire at these waste disposal sites. There were cases where
smouldering and beneath-ground fires at landfill areas started on their own during the
extreme heat of the prolonged dry spells such as that at Bukit Bakri Muar Landfill and
Pekan Nenas Pontian landfill in Johor in 2018, and those at Ladang Tanah Merah
sanitary landfill in Negeri Sembilan in 2021, resulting in serious consequences of haze
and air pollution.
Under the future scenario, prolonged extreme dry weathers were projected at some
existing facilities for solid wastes located in Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Johor, Sabah
and Selangor (late-century only) in some particular years throughout the century
(Table 4.45). Seven facilities from these states were projected to be prone to dry spells
by early-century, and the number is expected to increase to 10 facilities each by midcentury and late-century.

Sewerage Facilities
As of November 2023, there are some 7,503 public sewerage treatment plants (STPs)
and 1,454 network pumping stations (NPSs) facilities that are being operated and
maintained by the various operators of public sewerage in Peninsular Malaysia (SPAN
Water and Sewerage Factbook, 2022).
Floods
Impacts of flooding at sewerage facilities includes the overflow and shutting down of
the STP and NPS. These overflows at the STP and NPS will inevitably cause
deterioration to the water quality of the receiving water bodies downstream and nearby
rivers. Based on the flood areal extent maps at the current timeline (1971-2000) and
up to 2100, there could be 60 and 71 STPs and NPS, respectively, located in
Peninsular Malaysia affected by floods (Table 4.47). There are no significant changes
expected in terms of the number affected public STP and NPS at the two timelines, in
most of the states. Among the states, Selangor has the highest number of affected
STP and NPS at both timelines, followed by Perak, Pahang and Kuala Lumpur.

Dry Spells
There is no immediate direct impact due to dry spell to the sewerage facilities and
infrastructures. However, sewerage has always been identified as one of the river
pollution sources during dry spells resulting from the less dilution in the river water. By
upgrading and rationalization of old and small existing STPs and NPSs in the country,
it is anticipated that the favourable discharge of treated sewage effluent into rivers on
the other hand is able to increase the river flow during dry spell, with better waste
water environmental disposal management.
Sea Level Rise
There are no public STPs and NPSs reported being affected by SLR. However, there
may be impacts from SLR at several STP and NPS sites located nearer coastal areas,
which are privately maintained that are not reported.
The projected numbers of STPs and NPSs that could be inundated due to SLR at
current timeline, by 2050 and by 2100 were 402, 488 and 835 units, respectively (Table
4.48). There were no significant increments in the number of affected STPs and NPSs
by 2050 projected for each state, except for Kedah, Pulau Pinang, Perak, Selangor
and Johor. These five states also showed significant increments in the number of
affected STPs and NPSs by 2100.

Water Supply Facilities
As of 2022, there are 516 water treatment plants (WTP) recorded in Malaysia, of which
329 are located in Peninsular Malaysia, 83 in Sabah, 98 in Sarawak and 6 in Labuan.
Floods
Towards the end of 2021, water supply in various parts of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur
were disrupted due to the big floods that had occurred following heavy rainfall from 17
December to 19 December 2021. In Sarawak, some of the WTPs were also affected
by floods at various times in 2021-2022. Based on the flood areal extent maps for the
baseline timeline (1971-2000) and up to 2100, there could be 47 and 56 WTPs,
respectively, prone to floods (Table 4.49). Among the states, Sarawak Johor and
Pahang are expected to have the highest number of affected WTPs at both timelines.
There were no significant changes in the number of affected WTPs projected for each
state affected at the two timelines, except for Johor and Sarawak.

Dry Spells
The effect of dry spell will not only result in the drop of water levels at the water supply
dam reservoir, but also the drop in the river levels where the WTP draws its raw water
for treatment. Several water treatment plants in Perlis, Perak, Johor, Pahang, Kedah
and Selangor were reported to be affected by the occasional long dry spells that
appeared frequently over the past few years. In Sarawak, the production of potable
water at the WTP Kapit was affected in May 2022 due to low water level at the inlet
point. This WTP has been experiencing this issue since 2020.
For the future scenario, there were 11 WTPs projected to possibly be affected by dry
spells by early century (Table 4.50). These WTPS are located in Melaka and Sabah.
Further into the mid-century and late-century, about 28 and 38 WTPs, respectively,
could face similar dry spell impacts. These additional WTPs are located in Johor,
Selangor and Negeri Sembilan. However, the WTP Kapit in Sarawak, which
experienced dry spell impacts in the past, was not projected to face any dry spells in
future.

Assessment was also carried out using the projected river flow of the WTPs. Based
on the future river flow projection, it indicates that some WTPs located in Johor,
Melaka, Pulau Pinang and Sabah could face lower river flow in early-century. It was
also projected that those WTPs located in Pulau Pinang and Sabah could continue to
face the similar problem in mid-century and late-century. Thus, alternative water
sources should be planned and implemented immediately to minimise the impact on
the community and environment.
Sea Level Rise
SLR shows no clear impact on the WTPs, which are usually located in the middle and
upper catchment areas. However, for those WTPs located within certain distance from
the river mouth or at the barrages, special precaution should be taken. According to
the research carried out by NAHRIM at Sg. Rajang, Sg. Muar, Sg. Merbok and Sg.
Muda, saltwater intrusion up to 2 to 11 km from the river mouth are possible if 0.7 m
of SLR occurs in the late-century.
Flood Relief Centres
In Malaysia, schools, and multi-purpose and community halls, are usually used as
flood relief centres. There are approximately 7,353 numbers of flood relief centres
have been established in Peninsular Malaysia.
Floods
Based on the flood areal extent maps at baseline timeline (1971-2000) and up to 2100,
there could be 708 (9.6%) and 910 (12.4%) flood relief centres, respectively, located
in Peninsular Malaysia prone to floods (Table 4.51). Among the states, Perak and
Pahang are expected to have the highest number of affected flood relief centres at
both timelines, and this is followed by Selangor. Kedah showed significant increment
from 43 centres at baseline timeline (1971-2000) to 131 centres up to 2100.

4.8.2 Adaptation Measures
The phenomenon of climate change has resulted in more frequent and severe extreme
weather related disasters in urban areas. In order to reduce the impact of these
disasters through more effective spatial planning and land use, the PLANMalaysia has
prepared the Planning Guidelines for Disaster Resilient Cities in 2019 to be used by
the federal and state governments in their town planning and management. This
concept had been absorbed into the Fourth National Physical Plan 2021-2040 (NPP4),
which mainstreamed climate change agenda into the planning, emphasising on the
need to enhance adaptive measures to increase the country’s readiness to face
climate change impact in the future.
Cities & Built Environment
PLANMalaysia had also prepared the ‘Planning Guidelines for Disaster Resilient Cities
in Malaysia’ in 2019, which is used at the federal, state and local levels to reduce the
risk of natural disasters through spatial planning and land use. The ultimate purpose
is the building of resilient cities. The planning guidelines are aimed at (1) providing
references to identify the level of disaster resilience of cities; (2) proposing a method
of measuring the level of disaster resilience of cities; and (3) proposing a mechanism
for the management and implementation to achieve disaster resilient status of towns
and cities in Malaysia.
The PWD of Malaysia as the implementing agency for the development of public
infrastructure has introduced various standards, guidelines and initiatives towards
sustainable development that support the seven goals in the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). They have revised the ‘JKR Sustainability and Green Mission 2.0’ in
2017 covering all the types of development. The ‘JKR Strategic Plan 2021-2025’ was
developed to ensure the delivery of development projects and asset management are
at an excellent level and in line with the SDGs and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).
PWD of Malaysia has also issued various guideline documents as well as SIRIM
standards to be used as a reference in the construction industry. Therefore, in order
to maintain the commitment given, a new Sustainable Development Policy Book 2021178
2025, has been developed to continue to be inspirational towards achieving set
targets. PWD of Malaysia has also adopted the Environmental Management System
ISO 14001: 2015 (Environmental Management System) for the implementation of
infrastructure development projects located in environmentally sensitive areas.
A sustainable development rating scheme called the Green Rating (pH JKR) for
building and road projects was established as a tool to measure the level of
sustainability of a building and road in cities/towns. The ‘JKR Standard: JKR/SIRIM 2:
2020 Green Rating for Residential and Non-Residential Building Facilities’ was also
launched to promote sustainable development and climate resilience development in
the cities/towns.
The incidence of erosion and landslide at hill slopes may increase due to improper
geotechnical work and planning in the development. The PWD of Malaysia’s
Sustainable Development Policy was therefore established to minimise and balance
the earth cutting work at the built environments. The Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Plan (ESCP) by DID Malaysia is also being implemented to reduce the erosion
and sediments to be discharge into the rivers and ponds to prevent floods. Further to
this, all the new development activities in flood prone areas must be approved by the
‘National Physical Plan, Structure Plans and Local Plans’ to protect the built
environments and their surrounding areas.
Flooding is a common phenomenon in Malaysia. The recent devastating floods in the
country are examples of disaster likely due to climate change and anthropogenic
activities of urbanisation. Therefore, long-term solution plans to overcome flash flood
problems is an important approach for sustainable development in the country.
Stormwater Management and Drainage Master Plan (PISMA), which is one of the
frameworks of action that adopt the MSMA concept for stormwater management,
offers the preparation of short-term and long-term solution plans in a comprehensive
manner to overcome the flash floods in built environments of cities/towns. The
framework is used as guideline for the Local Authorities concern to systematically plan
for the development of the Local Council. A total of 45 PISMAs have been planned
under the RMK12, where 28 were completed with seven others in the development
process, and 10 in the planning process.
Several drought events have occurred in Malaysia since the recorded most severe
drought in 1997/1998. To cope with dry spell situations, PWD of Malaysia has
established a guideline on “System Design for Water Efficient Use in Buildings” to be
used by designer to design a system with less water. They are currently conducting
wastewater recycling system studies for their selected projects.
To promote good practices of water demand management in the country, in 2022,
SPAN through the Water Efficient Products Labelling Scheme (WEPLS) has
encouraged the suppliers in the development and marketing of water efficient products
as part of the water conservation measures, as well as to raise the awareness of the
public on the availability of water efficient products.
In 2022, initiative has been taken by some city councils to address the issues of climate
change. Think City together with UN-Habitat, Penang State Government, Penang
Island City Council and DID Malaysia have initiated to be the pioneer of nature-based
climate adaptation program for their urban areas. The program is to address the
climate change issues of heat stress and flooding, whilst strengthening social
resilience and institutional capacity.
As the most fastest growing economic zone in the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia,
Iskandar Malaysia is vulnerable to the disasters due to rapid urbanization and
increasing population, and exposure to the coastal hazards. The Iskandar Regional
Development Authority (IRDA) through the National Designated Entity of Malaysia was
awarded by United Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) Technical
Assistance (TA) for the Development of a Multi-Hazard Platform (MHP) for forecasting
local level climate extremes and physical hazards for Iskandar Malaysia.
Roads
There are various Standards Specifications for Road Works and technical guidelines
used by PWD of Malaysia for road design. PWD implements the Environmental
Management System (EMS) ISO 14001 for PWD projects, which requires the
mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report, a priori to proposal
submission. So far, climate related factors had not been incorporated into the current
design criteria. However, the Highway Network Development Masterplan (HNDP)
2007 has already considered environmentally sensitive and flood prone areas for new
and existing road development strategies, thus requiring deeper climate factor
considerations. Besides this, other adaptation measures by PWD also include
implementing Social Impact Assessment (SIA), Health Impact Assessment (HIA),
Wildlife Impact Assessment (WIA) studies and other management plans required by
relevant authorities in Malaysia, such as the Department of Environment (DOE),
PLANMalaysia, PERHILITAN and Department of Minerals & Geosciences.
In the event of floods, the PWD’s Disaster Operations Room (Bilik Gerakan Bencana
JKR) will provide the alternative routes for road users. The PWD’s e-disaster (eBencana) website also function as a database to identify recurring flooded areas. For
future road projects, the pavement design incorporates predictive climate models in
place of historical climate data, and the road alignment can be checked with revised
historical flood maps and future projected flood maps. The drainage design for the
roads shall comply with the MSMA. As of 31st December 2020, the total length of
Federal Roads constructed and being maintained by PWD is approximately 20,018
km. There is also approximately 247,027 km of State Road constructed and being
maintained by State PWD and other State Authorities. The degradation of the road
conditions may be partially attributed to bad weather conditions. Overall, frequent and
severe floods with increased wet situations would further deteriorate road conditions
thus needing additional maintenance efforts.
In adapting to SLR, new roads at coastal areas should be constructed at higher base
levels following future SLR estimations. Existing road formation levels should be
reviewed with proper wall protection systems, wherever necessary. The requirements
on buffer zones are to be reviewed, and the practice of including protective ecological
engineering approaches such as mangrove plantation ought to be considered. For
road projects planned at Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) such as water
catchment or coastal areas, EIA study is mandatorily required by DOE. Environmental
Consultants whom shall be appointed by PWD to investigate and report all potential
impacts from the proposed projects, are required to identify all required mitigation and
adaptation measures to reduce the impact on the environment.
Rails
The current practice of wet and dry weather inspection by KTMB’s patrolman is
important and should be enhanced to further reduce the occurrences of railway
operation disruption due to floods and dry spells.
Ports and Jetties
Several initiatives have been taken by The Navigation Security Section of Marine
Department Malaysia in order to adapt to haze conditions experience at the ports
during dry spell seasons. Some of these initiatives include the periodic dissemination
of information through NAVTEX (NAVigational TEleX), monitoring of meteorological
report from METMalaysia every six-hour, verbal information is made through operators
of the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), and staff members of The Navigation Security
Section are always on standby.
The current adaptation measures to SLR for jetties include the construction and raising
of existing rock revetment or bund, platform levels of jetty and walkway, construction
of wave buffer such as offshore breakwater or geotube, dredging river channel or river
mouth, and beach nourishment or replenishment.
Airports
For haze hazard that may occur during dry spells, the current actions conducted at the
airports include the activation of the Emergency Control Centre (ECC) when visibility
reading dropped to the critical level. Low Visibility Condition (LVC) operation will be
declared and several actions, including closure of runway and withdrawal of airside
activities, will be taken immediately until the LVC is improved. The Malaysian Fire and
Rescue Department (JBPM) are also on standby mode with more than 12,500
personnel for the purpose of operations at the areas at risk of fire and causing haze.
Solid Waste Facilities
In Malaysia, sanitary landfill is still the common method for the treatment of municipal
solid waste. Reduction of solid waste generation and solid waste recycling remains as
the best solution in solid waste management of the country. The recycling rate in 2020
was at 30.7%, and the Government is aiming to further increase the rate to 40% by
2025. This is in line with the National Cleanliness Policy 2019 to reduce solid waste
pollution as well as to promote the circular economy and waste-to-wealth initiatives.
This initiative will help to reduce the amount of solid waste going to the landfills hence
reducing the risk of leachate seeping into nearby water catchment areas.
Sewerage Facilities
Adaptation to floods in the sewerage sector should be taken during the planning and
operational stages. The Malaysian Sewerage Industry Guidelines (MSIG) has
specified that all the STPs and NPSs shall be constructed above the designed flood
level. Adequate drainage system within the STP and NPS compound, should be
designed by factoring in climate change. Apart from that, installation programs of the
Early Warning System (EWS) and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system at critical STPs and NPSs have been implemented for the purpose
of online operation monitoring. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and
Emergency Response Plan (ERP) shall be established and readily available to act
during severe flood events.
Water Supply Facilities
Adequate treated water supply capacity is essential to meet the increasing socioeconomic demand for water. A reserved margin of 15% of treated water in each state
in Peninsular Malaysia is targeted to ensure adequate supply of water during dry
spells. Adequate number and capacity of WTPs have to be made available to achieve
this reserved margin. Protection of the facilities at the WTPs from floods and saltwater
intrusion, as well as regular maintenance, are necessary. For extreme dry spells,
sufficient water level at the intake points is required.
For the Klang Valley, where the largest country’s economic activity is located and most
impacted during dry spells, Air Selangor Sdn Bhd has identified new alternative water
sources to ensure sustainable water supply in the region. A total of five to ten existing
tin mining ponds located in the district of Sepang and Petaling have been identified as
potential water sources in the form of ‘Off-River Storage Facility’ (ORS) through a
project called the Rasau Water Supply Scheme. The scheme is expected to produce
clean water supply of up to 700 MLD to the Klang Valley by the first stage of completion
in 2024. In Selangor, the government is rolling out a 10-year plan in 2023 to study and
implement an interconnected system linking the 98 lakes in the state, with river basins
as part of a state-wide water resources scheme. As part of the ORS, the Hybrid Offriver Augmentation System (HORAS), was constructed in Selangor in 2014. The
Selangor State Government has identified the HORAS 3000 project as a long-term
solution for the water resources development to be utilized by the year 2065.
Another successful adaptation measure is the Pool Water Pumping Operation (OPAK)
initiated by the Selangor Water Management Board (LUAS) at Bestari Jaya, Selangor,
following the period of dry weather conditions and the drop in the dam water level in
2014. Since then, the OPAK has continued to be setup at other river basins, as an
additional supplementary water source to increase river capacity and optimize dam
water release. In 2016, the OPAK was successfully used to overcome the water supply
disruption problem in Selangor River when it experienced a severe drop in the river
water level.
Flood Relief Centres
The National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA), as the one-stop agency for
disaster management, along with the states’ disaster management mechanism,
manages disaster relief and recovery during floods and other disasters in the country.
The disaster management is continuing improved with lessons learnt from each
disaster including the provisions of heavy rainfall forecast by MET Malaysia and early
warning of floods by DID Malaysia, as well as the management of relief centres by the
Department of Social Welfare. The risk of flooding to the relief centres needs to be
continuing assessed to ensure safety of these centres from floods.
4.9
Energy
4.9.1 Impact and Vulnerability
Electricity Generation, Transmission and Distribution
Rapid development and steady economic growth in the country over the past decades,
have contributed to a healthy increase in demand for electricity generation. Currently,
there are a total of 33 power plants (21 thermal power plants and 12 hydropower
plants), 86,468 substations and 33,668 transmission towers located in Peninsular
Malaysia. In Sabah, there are one hydropower plant and five thermal power plants,
while in Sarawak there are five hydropower plants and five thermal power plants. The
power plants mentioned above are those with 50 megawatts and above of capacity.
Floods
Based on the flood areal extent maps, three hydropower plants from Perak and
Kelantan, and one thermal power plant from Selangor, were assessed to be vulnerable
to floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000). The same four plants were also projected
to be vulnerable to floods up to 2100. The projected number of substations in
Peninsular Malaysia vulnerable to floods could substantially increase from 5,897
substations at the baseline timeline (1971-2000) to 7,093 substations up to 2100.
Extreme Wet and Dry Spells
High rainfall at dam catchments increases water storage in the hydropower dams and
subsequently could lead to dam overflow and structural failure. At the other extreme,
a prolonged dry spell will reduce the water storage in dams, leading to insufficient
water for operating hydropower plants. Both floods and dry spells, could also affect
the operations of thermal power plants. Dry spells will disrupt the cooling process of
the plants, while floods will affect the plant infrastructure.
Based on the projected extreme wet weather in Peninsular Malaysia, the 12
hydropower plants located in Perak, Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu could be
prone to upstream floods at some particular years throughout the century (Table 4.52
& Figure 4.11). The same eight hydropower plants that are located in Perak and
Pahang could be facing dry spells risks, when the projected extreme low rainfalls could
happen at some particular times during the mid-century and late-century in the future.
There are eight hydropower plants, four in Sabah and four in Sarawak (including one
under construction), were also projected to be flood prone at some particular future
years throughout the century (Table 4.52 & Figure 4.12). The same four hydropower
plants located in Sarawak could be facing dry spell risks as well for the same period
(Table 4.53).

plants could be facing dry spell risks at some particular years of certain future periods
(mid-century and/or late-century) based on the projected extreme future low rainfalls
(Table 4.55).

This number is expected to increase to 4,991 (+20.6%) and 8,003 (+93.4%) by 2050
and 2100, respectively.
There were three thermal power plants projected to be prone to SLR at current
baseline (2022) (Table 4.56). These three plants were also projected to be affected by
SLR by 2050 and 2100. The total numbers of affected plants are estimated to increase
to four plants by 2050 and seven plants by 2100.

A total of 1,140 PETRONAS assets, which comprise of 76 core business (13 upstream
business – inland only, 10 gas business, and 53 downstream business – including
petrol stations, depots and terminals) and 1,064 retail stations, were assessed for their
vulnerability to climate change.
Floods
The number of probable impacted PETRONAS assets in the country was projected to
increase from the baseline timeline (1971-2000) of 111 to 132 up to 2100. The
projected assets that are at risk at current timeline include two core business assets
in Kuala Lumpur, and three operation sites and offices in Sarawak. The balance of the
106 potential assets are mostly retail stations, with 70 located in Peninsular Malaysia
and 36 in Sabah and Sarawak. Up to 2100, no change is expected in the projected
potential impacted assets for Upstream, Downstream and Gas businesses except for
the retail station assets that could increase from 106 to 127. These include 90 assets
located in Peninsular Malaysia and 37 in Sabah and Sarawak.
Dry Spells
All the inland PETRONAS assets were assessed for future dry spell hazard, except
for the retail stations organised under PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad (PDB). A total
of 70 assets were projected to be affected by dry spells in some particular years by
late-century. These comprised of 12 upstream businesses, 48 downstream
businesses and 10 gas businesses. Upstream business has more onshore offices that
are estimated not vulnerable to water stress, while downstream business and gas
business have more temperature sensitive equipment and thus are more vulnerable.
Retail stations are expected not to be significantly affected due to the nature of their
business.
Extreme High Temperature
Extreme high temperature would lead to heat stress on operations and the workability
of staff. The potential changes in future temperature were therefore analysed for the
PETRONAS assets located at Gurun, Melaka, Pengerang, Gebeng, Kerteh, Bintulu,
Miri and Labuan, which are the areas where PETRONAS has the largest footprints. It
was projected that Gurun could record the highest maximum temperature of 39.5°C in
late-century. This was followed by Melaka, where a maximum temperature of 38.1°C
is expected in the same period. At Gurun, there were seven occasions of spike in
temperature projected to occur by late-century, and reaching a maximum temperature
of 38.0°C every 3 to 5 years. Significant projection was also found in Melaka, where
11 occasions of spike in temperature, reaching a maximum temperature of 38.0°C
(late-century), are expected. High maximum temperatures range from 35.0°C to
38.0°C by 2100 were also projected for Gebeng, Labuan and Miri.
In terms of temperature gradient rise, in Melaka, where PETRONAS Penapisan
(Melaka) Sdn Bhd is located, it was projected to experience the highest temperature
gradient rise of 0.36°C per decade. Meanwhile, Pengerang, Labuan and Bintulu are
among the areas that were also projected to be susceptible to high gradients of
temperature rise of 0.22-0.26°C per decade.
The assets located in these areas could be vulnerable to significant changes in
temperature. Nevertheless, detailed modelling and analysis is required for a better
understanding of their vulnerabilities and risks.
Sea Level Rise
The projected number of assets to be affected by SLR is expected to increase from
the current timeline (2022) of 44 assets to 55 assets by 2050. More significant
increment was projected by 2100, where a total of 83 assets (5.0% from the upstream
business, 4.0% from the downstream business, and the remaining 91.0% are the retail
stations) are expected to be affected. The majority of PETRONAS assets that have
the most probability of being affected are its retail stations since they are widely
distributed throughout the country. It was found that the top four states affected are
Selangor (19 stations), Penang and Johor (14 stations each); and Kedah (12 stations).
Notable PETRONAS assets from Upstream Business that could be potentially at risk
were projected in Bintulu, Miri and Kerteh; while from Downstream Business, the same
were projected in Pulau Pinang and Johor.
4.9.2 Adaptation Measures
Electricity Generation, Transmission and Distribution
The following adaptation measures have been implemented for the electricity sector:
Floods
● An integrated catchment management policy, procedures, and guidelines to
regulate power supply among the catchments during floods;
● Flood drills to improve the standard operating procedures, better managed
critical situations and safely restore the electricity supply;
● Integrated Community-Based Disaster Management (ICBDM) program;
● Prompt shutdown of affected substations through the early warning systems to
avoid/prevent/contain damages;
● Installation of protective measures around the substations such as flood walls,
flood gates, flap gates and pumping systems to reduce the water level inside
the substation area;
● Raised heights of transmission towers;
● Conduct necessary hydrological review to establish the new Probable
Maximum Precipitation (PMP) and Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) values for
Hydropower Plant;
● Review and revise of the design PMF and spillway capacity by updating from
previous study for Kenyir Dam and latest Kenyir Dam incident; and
● Implement Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) approach to ensure
Sustainable Hydropower Dam Safety Management for Kenyir
Dry Spells
Temporary storage tanks or/and alternative water sources (groundwater, treated
saline water, and recycled brackish groundwater and municipal wastewater) as an
addition to the existing water sources and increasing storage volumes to ensure ample
water supply to thermal power plants at all times, especially during dry weather
conditions.
4.10
Public Health
4.10.1 Impact and Vulnerability
Healthcare Facilities
The Malaysia healthcare systems have been improving over the years, with a doctor
to patient ratio of 1:420 as at 2021, dispersed throughout 367 hospitals including
special medical institutions (158 public and 209 private) and 11,117 clinics (2,895
public and 8,222 private). Climate change does pose a significant threat to these
facilities, where extreme weather events have disrupted operations, making provision
of high-quality services difficult. The vulnerability of healthcare facilities therefore
needs to be taken into cognizance to enable advanced planning and implementation
of adaptive management strategies for more resilient towards challenges arising.
Floods
Floods in December 2021 to January 2022 had affected 138 MOH healthcare facilities
with an estimated RM 11,297,000 of infrastructure damage. Until July 2022, a total
allocation of RM 2,502,195 was utilised for the replacement of damaged assets in the
four major affected states (Selangor, Kelantan, Pahang, and Terengganu). Over the
past six years (from 2016 to 2021), a total of RM 8,684,922 had been allocated for
maintenance and repairing works of 75 healthcare facilities affected by floods (Figure
4.16).
Healthcare Facilities from 2016 to 2021
Impact of floods on the MOH healthcare facilities was assessed at 146 hospitals
(including special medical institutions) and 1,141 health clinics located at the 37 river
basins in Malaysia (Table 4.57). The assessment showed that 17 hospitals and 125
health clinics were prone to floods at baseline timeline (1971-2000). These numbers
are expected to increase to 19 hospitals and 149 health clinics, respectively, up to
2100. In Peninsular Malaysia, two additional hospitals located at the Johor River basin
and Kerian River basin are expected to be prone to floods up to 2100. Health clinics
in Peninsular Malaysia could be more vulnerable to floods with an increment of 22
flood prone health clinics expected up to 2100, especially in Kedah, Perak, Pahang
and Kelantan River basins. However, no significant changes were projected for Sabah
and Sarawak for the same period.

SLR at current timeline (2022). This number is expected to remain the same by 2050,
however, four more hospitals, one each from Perak, Selangor, Sabah and Sarawak,
are expected to be prone to SLR by 2100. Health clinics could be more vulnerable to
SLR inundations. This is shown by the projected increments of 5 and 37 affected
health clinics by 2050 and 2100, respectively.

Vector Borne Diseases
Dengue
Malaysia is a dengue endemic country where cases are reported all year round.
Dengue is one of the mandatory notifiable diseases for medical practitioners in
Malaysia under the Prevention and Control of infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342).
All premises in Malaysia are prohibited from harbouring disease bearing insects
including Aedes mosquitoes under Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act 1975
(Act 154).
The El Niño events observed in 2014-2016 and 2018-2019 had affected Malaysia’s
local climate and become a crucial climate driver to dengue outbreaks. There were
130,101 dengue cases reported in 2019, which was the highest occurrence of dengue
cases in Malaysia for the past 20 years, compared to 120,836 cases in 2015 (Figure
4.17). However, despite the alarming number of dengue cases, the dengue death in
2019 (182 deaths) was reported to be fewer compared to 2015 (336 deaths). The case
and death continued to decrease since then, and achieved the lowest in 2021. Since
2018, dengue case fatality rate (CFR) continues to decrease below the CFR target of
0.2% until it reached the lowest of 0.08% in 2021 (Figure 4.18). However, the drastic
decrease in 2020-2021 could have probably been attributed to the reduced population
mobility enforced during the Movement Control Order (MCO) following the COVID-19
pandemic.
Malaria
Malaysia has come a long way in the malaria prevention and control programs since
the discovery of malaria transmission in 1900s. The requirement to notify malaria
cases is governed by the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act (1988)
under Section 10 (c) Act 342. Even though human malaria cases were drastically
reduced since the introduction of malaria eradication programs in 1960, Malaysia has
been moving into addressing simian malaria caused by the Plasmodium knowlesi.
Malaysia is currently on track for malaria elimination by successfully sustaining the
status of zero indigenous case of human malaria, for four consecutive years since
2018. Despite achieving the status, Malaysia is facing the increasing trend of zoonotic
malaria from Plasmodium knowlesi infection. Zoonotic malaria cases had increased
ten-fold from less than 400 in 2008 to over 4,000 in 2018. Although cases showed
reducing trend in 2019 and 2020, but it had unexpectedly increased to 3,575 cases in
2021 with 13 deaths (Figure 4.19).
Vector Borne Disease Sector, Ministry of Health Malaysia)
There are evidences that malaria in warmer regions has shifted toward higher
altitudes, for example, the malaria susceptibility index and zoning analyses found that
areas located along the Crocker Range of Sabah were highly susceptible to
Plasmodium knowlesi infections. Besides, the changes in land use, deforestation,
migration and travelling were at the same time, also identified as the main factors
influencing zoonotic malaria transmission.
Food and Water Borne Diseases
Food and Water Borne Disease (FWBD) is a notifiable disease under Section 10 (c)
Act 342, the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act (1988). The five
notifiable FWBDs in Malaysia are food poisoning, typhoid (including paratyphoid),
cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis A. These diseases usually appear as sporadic
outbreaks, and the incidences are linked to water sanitation and hygiene including the
unavailability of safe potable water supply in some rural areas.
The trend of FWBD has been fluctuating over the past 20 years (Figure 4.20). The
overall incidence of FWBD was reported with lower rate over the past 5 years. This
can be specifically seen in the trend of cholera and typhoid including paratyphoid.
Malaysia for 2000-2021 (Source: VPD/ FWBD Sector MOH)
Disruptions of infrastructure, water supply and sanitation systems may exacerbate the
risks of FWBD transmission. This was the case during the 2014 flood when the typhoid
fever and cholera transmission incidence rates were higher during post flood (2015)
with the incidence rates of 1.42 and 0.80 per 100,000 population, respectively.
The incidence rate of food poisoning fluctuated but followed a consistent pattern over
the past 10 years before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. During the COVID19 pandemic, the incidence rate significantly declined from 51.74 per 100,000
population in 2019 to 17.54 per 100,000 population in 2021. This was likely a result of
the enforcement of MCOs that reduced population mobility during the COVID-19
pandemic.
Minimal number of deaths were reported for FWBD in the past ten years, especially
for food poisoning, dysentery and hepatitis A with almost zero reporting case (Figure
4.21).
2000-2021 (Source: VPD/ FWBD Sector MOH)
Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is the most widespread emerging infectious zoonosis, especially in
tropical regions, affecting animals including livestock by its different manifestations
and can cause considerable economic losses. Since 2011, leptospirosis is one of the
mandatory notifiable diseases by medical practitioners in Malaysia under the
Prevention and Control of infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342).
The incidence of leptospirosis was noted to increase in numbers since its recognition
as a notifiable disease in 2011 (Figure 4.22). The highest number of cases was notified
in 2015 after the large flood of December 2014 to January 2015, in the east coast and
northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. The observed impacts demonstrated a
complex influence of climatic factors on the dynamic of leptospirosis transmission
between humans, zoonotic animals and the environment.
Leptospirosis transmission was observed to be interrupted during the COVID-19
pandemic with incidence rate reduced from 15.61 per 100,000 population in 2019 to
5.15 per 100,000 population in 2021 (Figure 4.23). In contrast, the case of fatality rate
showed increment from 0.61% in 2019 to 1.42% in 2021.
2011 to 2021
Heat Related Illness
Prolonged periods of lower precipitation, high humidity and higher-than-average
temperature will have negative health impacts on human and livelihood. Overexposure to high temperatures can cause an immediate effect or acute illness such as
heat rash, heat cramps, exhaustion, syncope, heat stroke, and even death. Extreme
temperatures can also aggravate chronic conditions such as cardiovascular,
respiratory, and cerebrovascular disease, and resulting in increased excess mortality
and hospitalisation.
Malaysia had experienced heatwave events in 2016 and 2019. The year 2016 was the
hottest year ever in Malaysian history with the recorded maximum temperature of
39.3°C. This hot weather was strongly influenced by the natural climate variability of a
strong El Niño from 2015 to 2016. Heatwaves were then recorded in the northern
states of Peninsular Malaysia, Pahang, Kelantan, and Keningau, Sabah. There were
200 cases of heat related illness, including 22 cases of heat stroke (11%), 126 cases
of heat exhaustion (63%), and 52 cases of heat cramp (26%) were reported during
this heatwave episode (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2016). In comparison to 2016, the
heatwave episodes in 2019 were not as severe and prolonged.
Direct health effects from heat and light exposure are classified as Code T67 of the
International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). During the warmest
years in Malaysia from 2015 to 2019, the highest number of hospital admission for
ICD-10 Code T67 was recorded in 2016 (Figure 4.24).
2015-2019 (Source: Health Informatics Centre, Ministry of Health Malaysia)
4.10.2 Adaptation Measures
Healthcare Facilities
Extreme weather events and climate related disasters such as floods have impacts on
the healthcare infrastructure and facilities, as well as the operation of healthcare
systems. The MOH has therefore planned to relocate flood prone healthcare facilities
to higher ground in order to provide uninterrupted services during flood events. In
Kelantan, which was the worst hit area during the 2014 flood, 12 of the severely
impacted healthcare facilities were identified for re-development purposes. The
healthcare facilities were relocated and rebuilt with more climate resilient design and
structures.
Simultaneously, the Water and Sanitation for Health Facility Improvement Tool (WASH
FIT) is being used as a risk-based approach to improve and sustain healthcare water,
sanitation, hygiene and waste management, as well as facilitating care of the
environment. The baseline WASH data collection was carried out in 2021 for the
selected 146 MOH hospitals and special medical institutions. Using the WASH service
ladders and the WASH FIT methodology, the MOH has also developed various
national standards, guidelines, and accountability mechanisms for resilient facilities.
Vector Borne Diseases
Dengue
Since 2014, it is mandatory to have all registered dengue cases undergo confirmatory
serology testing. The real time web-based on dengue surveillance systems such as enotification, e-Dengue and Dengue Outbreak Management System (SPWD) are
available for detailed information on the disease. The Dengue Virus Serotype
Surveillance Program acts as a platform in sentinel surveillance of circulating dengue
serotype. Vector control activities such as source reduction, community mobilization,
and chemical and biological control, were successfully adopted through the Integrated
Vector Management (IVM). The Disease Control Division of MOH has recently
established the National Strategy Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control Program
(2022-2025).
Malaria
Malaysia has ended the National Strategic Malaria Elimination Plan in 2021 with no
indigenous case of human malaria reported for four consecutive years. However,
Malaysia is still exposed to the risk of imported human malaria infection through influx
of foreign workers, as well as increasing threats of zoonotic malaria infections.
Therefore, five new adaptation strategies and approaches have been implemented to
prevent the reintroduction of malaria in this country. These include (i) rural community
participation on malaria programme, (ii) universal coverage on malaria diagnosis,
treatment, and vector control, (iii) development of new malaria risk stratification based
on receptivity and vulnerability, (iv) enhancement of malaria surveillance using GIS
and remote sensing technology, and (v) strengthening entomological surveillance
using GIS and remote sensing technology.
Necessary services and supplies such as vector control supplies and equipment
storage are provided for the high-risk populations, which include the Orang Asli,
mobile, migrant and other hard-to-reach populations, through the Malaysia National
Malaria Prevention and Control Programme. For many years and is still continuing,
local villagers and volunteers were recruited in assisting malaria surveillance and
control activities at local level.
In 2016, the Malaysia FOCI (MyFOCI) system was developed to collect receptivity,
vulnerability and malaria outbreak investigative data for foci stratification purposes.
Subsequently, an online Malaysia Entomology and Pest Information System
(myEntoPest) was also developed for the same purpose. All the data and information
will be analysed through the Malaria Geo-Reference Information & Coordination
System for Malaria Elimination (MAGICs.ME) with built-in prediction module for
malaria risk mapping
Food and Water Borne Diseases
The Disease Control Division and Institute for Medical Research (IMR) under the MOH
are the institutional members of the Global Salmonella Surveillance (GSS). The
Disease Control Division is constantly improving its surveillance, investigation, and
management of emerging and re-emerging diseases, allowing for immediate case
notification and timely intervention. In May 2007, the National Crisis Preparedness and
Response Centre (CPRC) was established. The centre is equipped with standard
operating procedures for emergency and disaster management, and responsible for
managing disease outbreak response activities.
The Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease Act (Act 342) took effect in 1988 is
continually enforced. Establishment of an online notification system, e-notifikasi, has
allowed early warning and better surveillance through continuous monitoring of FWBD
and early detection of new outbreaks. Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) surveillance is
currently being implemented in the health facilities, and reported weekly at the district
and state levels.
Leptospirosis
Under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 [Act 342], the MOH
had made it mandatory to notify all leptospirosis cases (both probable and labconfirmed cases) through the eNotifikasi System, since 2011. Guidelines for the
Diagnosis, Management, Prevention and Control of Leptospirosis in Malaysia was also
developed in 2011 to provide disease information and guidance on diagnostic criteria,
management of diagnostic samples and notification procedures. Laboratory tests are
mandatory for all leptospirosis cases, particularly those requiring hospitalisation as
well as fatal cases. At the same time, a real time web-based eNotifikasi and eWabak
System for surveillance of leptospirosis is being implemented as part of enhancing the
early warning process.
The control and prevention plan for leptospirosis is implemented through four
strategies: (i) enhanced surveillance and sharing of information, (ii) coordinated multiagencies prevention and control activities, (iii) risk reduction, and (iv) research and
development.
Heat Related Illness
A National Heatwave Action Plan Technical Committee was set up to address the
issue of extreme temperatures and heatwaves. A baseline definition and action plan
for dealing with future heatwaves and extreme weather occurrences had then been
established. As response to the 2016 heatwave, the MOH has established the Clinical
Guidelines on Management of Heat-Related Illness in Health Clinics and Emergency
and Trauma Departments to focus on the clinical management of heat-related
illnesses.
In 2021, the MOH had issued an action plan on health risk management during
heatwave, which acts as a guideline that incorporated health action throughout all
phases of the heatwave. The National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) will
take over the heatwave management should a level 3 alert strike, as this is classified
as a national emergency (ambient air temperatures higher than 40°C).

Improvement Plan
4.11.1 Climate Change Projection
Improvements to the of climate projections would continually be carried out. This would
include inputs from six GCMs for dynamic downscaling and 20 GCM outputs for
statistical downscaling containing the four Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSPs:
SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) scenarios in the IPCC’s Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6). The downscaling would be carried out at 6 km grid
resolutions for Malaysia. Hybrid downscaling to higher resolution for the selected
urban areas will be carried out.
The outputs from the downscaling projections would be used for improving sectoral
vulnerability and adaptation assessments. Based on the new projected hydroclimate
data, flood areal extent modelling and map developments would be carried out for at
least 37 flood prone river basins that cover about 70.3% of the country’s land area. An
additional hydrological drought index dry will be developed on top of the
meteorological drought index to better reflect the consequences of dry spells. Land
surface hydrological modelling for producing projected river flow at specific reservoirs
/ dams will also be enhanced.
4.11.2 Sea Level Rise and Coastal Inundation Projections
The assessment of the coastal vulnerability to SLR requires high accuracy digital
elevation model (DEM) data, nearshore and estuaries bathymetric data, which are
expensive to acquire. The high-resolution numerical model, which is used to assess
and identify the potential coastal inundation due to the projected sea level rise, is under
way.
The trend of observed SLR will be evaluated by compiling the long-term satellite
altimetry data. This trend is useful to examine the outside factors such as ENSO that
may influence the future sea level assessment. Furthermore, dynamical downscaling
for SLR will be carried out for selected CMIP6 climate models. Coastal flood inundation
and saltwater intrusion simulations using TWO dimensional (2D) numerical coastal
hydrodynamic model will then be carried out. In addition, sea surface temperature
projection will also be carried out based on the SSP scenarios in AR6. The outputs
can be compared using the available reanalysis data provided by the global agencies.
4.11.3 Water and Coastal Resources Sector
There are indeed uncertainties on the assessment of climate change impacts on flood
prone areas due to unavailable future land use information. Current flood protection
and adaptation measures are insufficient to provide total flood solutions due to climate
change impact. The climate change factors (CCF) needs to be fully incorporated into
the design and construction of water structures and projects.
For the coastal inundation issue due to SLR, the ISMP studies have not been fully
conducted at all the coastal regions in the country. There are also not enough studies
and insufficient assessment on saltwater intrusion into the groundwater aquifers in the
coastal areas. Extensive hazard study needs to be carried out.
Adaptation projects and programs against climate change vulnerability are still sectoral
orientation. There is uncertainty on the effectiveness of these assessments and
adaptations when taking into account inter-sector considerations. It is suggested to
carry out full chain impact assessment to incorporate embedded inter-sector issues.
4.11.4 Agriculture and Food Security Sector
Rice
In order to further understand the effects of climate change on rice production, crop
modelings such as continuous crop development models that integrate physiological
growth process model, water consumption and fertilizer consumed, yield prediction,
etc., has been carried out for the granary areas. However, there is also a need to
extend the efforts to the non-granary areas.
Further study to evaluate crop establishment techniques and varietal performance
under extreme climate conditions is needed to further improve the production of rice.
Technological adaptation to climate change is also important to deal with the climatic
problems in the long run.
Early warning system for pest and disease incidence detection due to changes in
weather patterns and extreme weather events; soil remediation improvement due to
seawater intrusion and floods, are among the remedies of climate change impacts that
are needed to be implemented. In addition, the effect of daily night temperature on rice
growth is an area of study that needs to be properly determined.
Livestock
Further exploration is necessary on local livestock breed needs, management
practices, disease control and climate adaptation towards ensuring sustainability. New
land areas suitable for livestock farming and growing of feed crops need to be
identified. Local environment suitable for the imported ruminant breeds for
bioprospecting purposes also needs to be identified.
Fisheries and Aquaculture
Changes in sea surface temperature, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), sea level,
inland water temperatures, rainfall severity and frequency, and water availability, may
directly affect the fishery industry and aquaculture productions. Therefore, dedicated
weather services including accurate and timely extreme weather prediction should be
introduced to provide early warning to farmers and culturists in order to reduce
economic loss due to climate change impact.
Oil Palm
Research on development of more productive varieties of oil palm that are resilient to
climate stress through the cooperations of industries and stakeholders need to be
extended and strengthened. Regional and seasonal climate change modelling
approaches, which reveal future patterns of climate scenarios, should be adopted into
management practices to enhance the resilience and productivity of oil palm. In
addition, the policy on sustainable land use and best management practices should
be adhere to avoid unnecessary expansion of oil palm plantations.
Rubber
To enhance the productivity and sustainability, an evaluation of the Genetic by
Environment (G x E) influence through assessment of latex production and
performance stability of rubber clones across multiple localities needs to be carried
out. The assessments of the consequences of environmental changes affecting the
development of pests and diseases, and the potential emergence of new diseases,
should be continued.
Cocoa
As with the other commodity crops, cocoa-crop development models are needed to
further understand the effects of climate change on cocoa. There is a need to intensify
the research activities, especially the baseline information, on the impact of climate
change to cocoa productions.
4.11.5 Forestry and Biodiversity Sector
Attributing causes of climate change impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity in
general is complex. Incomplete information is one of the main knowledge gaps that
affect the planning and implementation of climate change adaptation measures for the
sector. This is further compounded by the problems in integrating different knowledge
systems. Ongoing research and monitoring programmes therefore need to be
continued.
The problems that affected the country’s marine protected areas are too numerous to
be handled by only a few parties. Major paradigm shifts are needed to ensure the
sustainability of conservation efforts can be carried out for long-term purposes. One
such programme will involve co-management among government-private-civil society
by joining hands in tackling some of the basic problems such as solid waste, air
pollution, over-harvesting, governance and habitat losses.
Marine turtle conservation efforts in Malaysia are not lacking, but need to be upgraded
and coordinated. Community’s participation and co-management is a strategic
approach for successful conservation interventions. It is therefore envisaged to
increase education and awareness of marine turtles and their habitats, conservation
needs and threats, amongst the wider public to enhance public participation in
conservation activities. Partnership with various stakeholder and business entity can
contribute to the sustainable financing mechanism in conserving this species.
The status of all cetacean species is currently unknown due to the lack of historical
information and scientific research work has just begun. Primary data collection is still
in progress. A proper management plan for marine mammals in Marine Park areas is
also needed.
4.11.6 Cities, Built Environment and Infrastructure Sector
Cities and Built Environment
The towns and cities and their built environments continue to face increasing flash
floods. The concept of diversion network systems for temporary storage of diverted
flood water should be widely accepted and implemented in any future development.
Future new towns and cities and built environment plannings should consider the
projected future flood areal extent and coastal inundation zonings. Improved early
warning systems need to be in place to reduce the losses due to such floods.
As for SLR, the strategy is to prevent further loss of towns and cities, and built
environment areas, along the coastal zones. More cautious consideration should be
given to future coastal land use and development approval with the increasing inland
intrusion of the coastal inundation arising from SLR. The Coastal Erosion Control
Programme for the conservation and repairing works along the shorelines, and The
ISMP study to assess the risks of coastal erosions on shorelines, being implemented
currently should be accelerated to minimise the impact of SLR on the coastal towns
and cities and built environments.
Roads
Road projects should take into account the climate change factor (CCF) and exposure
to future flood zones and SLR in their design and alignment. The road drainage design
shall continue to comply with the Urban Stormwater Management Manual for Malaysia
(Manual Saliran Mesra Alam, MSMA).
With respect to dry spells, new strategies which involve improvement of materials such
as rut resistant asphalt mixtures, usage of binders that aged slower and usage of
asphalt pavement preservation techniques should be introduced. The review of current
pavement materials, and evaluation of its robustness with respect to changes in the
environment such as temperature and moisture should be conducted before their
implementation of new materials. It should also initiate evaluation studies on costs and
benefits of modifying the existing materials in order to be more robust.
For the existing and future coastal roads, continuing work on identifying coastal
inundated areas, improving designs and maintenance of coastal bunds, rock
revetment, beach nourishment and break water structures, for protection of these
roads are of utmost importance needed against the impact of SLR. The requirements
on buffer zones need to be reviewed and the practise of ecological engineering
establishment approaches such as replanting mangrove forest should be prioritised.
Rails
The free board and culverts of railway bridges should be designed incorporating the
climate change factor and following the Design Best Practices. The climate change
factor should also be incorporated in the design of electrification masts depth and
close turf slopes, which follow the Standard Design Specifications and Design Best
Practices. Steps to be taken for resilience to SLR inundations on new railways include
constructing track and railway facilities at higher elevation. Inland and coastal flood
inspections by KTMB’s Patrolman or Flying Gang should become a norm in railway
operation.
Ports and Jetties
Currently, ports and jetties in Malaysia are facing difficulties in developing the exact
quantification of necessary adaptation measures to cope with SLR and coastal floods.
The operators of port infrastructures should therefore be provided with projected SLR
and coastal inundation maps in order for them to estimate the level of platforms
required.
Lack of technology and expertise on coastal erosion prediction and control measures
is an obstacle in the sector. Technology that is able to minimize the impact of erosion
and siltation on the ports and jetties as a result of higher sea levels and encroaching
coastal inundations, should be introduced. More human capacity in coastal erosion
modelling should be built.
Airports
It is recommended that the selection of locations of new airports should refer to the
projected future flood areal extent maps and coastal inundation maps.
Solid Waste Facilities
In Malaysia, one of the major gaps in solid waste management is that no authority has
been given the jurisdiction of handling all the seven types of waste - solid, agricultural,
construction, radioactive, mining, sewage and scheduled waste. A centralised
authority should be established to comprehensively solve this predicament.
Implementation of the National Solid Waste Management Plan (NSWNP 2016)
requires additional allocation for its comprehensive implementation. In addition, the
Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing ACT 2007, which has been adopted
by Johor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Kedah, Perlis, Kuala Lumpur and
Putrajaya, needs to be promoted further to be accepted by the remaining states.
On the technology front, existing sanitary landfills or dumpsites, which are vulnerable
to floods and dry spells, should be replaced with more advanced technology such as
incinerators that are more resilient to climate change.
Sewerage Facilities
There is no direct impact due to dry spells to sewerage facility. However, via upgrading
and rationalization of old and small existing STPs and NPSs through the latest
technologies, it is anticipated that the discharge of treated sewage effluent into low
river flow during dry spells can occur with less impact. Through establishment of the
Water Reuse Policy and Guidelines, the bio effluent can be recycled for non-potable
usage to reduce dependency on treated water supply. Constructed wetland is
suggested to be used as an additional filtering mechanism before discharging into the
river, which is suitable for less habitat size or island.
With respect to SLR, all the new STPs and NPSs shall be mandated to be constructed
well above the revised coastal flood level due to inundation, if not all together have the
affected STP/NPS relocate to more appropriate places.
Water Supply Facilities
To address the problem of flooded water intake structures of water treatment plants,
diversion structures can be proposed to divert the flood water from inundating the
intake point. For solving the problem of turbidity of river water due to more frequent
extreme weather events such as floods and dry spells under the changing climate,
there should be openness towards adopting new advances in water treatment
technology.
The Water Demand Management Master Plan completed under the Eleventh Malaysia
Plan will enhance sustainable water supply and demand for the future. For urban
areas, reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) would help to conserve water. The
government plans to reduce NRW loss from the 2020 level of 35% to 25% by 2025
and 20% by 2030. The plan also targets the reduction of domestic water consumption
from the 2020 level of 205 litres per capita per day (LCD) to 180 LCD by 2025 and 160
LCD by 2030.
Flood Relief Centres
To enable better assessment of the vulnerability of flood relief centres to future floods,
a complete national database of these buildings including information on their location
and elevation needs to be developed. The existing design standards and guidelines
for buildings, especially those serve as flood relief centres need to be reviewed
periodically, and the climate change factors should be incorporated. The design
standards and guidelines for development in coastal areas need to be enhanced to
enable proactive adaptation to sea level rise.
4.11.7 Energy Sector
According to the national standards, the adopted practices above can be enhanced
with an integrated approach to the energy sector, both from the structural and nonstructural perspective. Non-structural adaptation encompasses management,
operational or policy changes, and capacity-building and knowledge management
activities. These include modifying design standards for transmission and distribution
infrastructure to increase resilience; training or demonstrations of end-use energy
efficiency measures; and institutional changes to support mainstreaming
consideration of climate change into development and sector strategies. A more
rigorous assessment of the impact of climate change on the energy sector needs to
be carried out.
Some of the potential flood adaptation measures for hydropower plants include:
● Incorporating climate change factors into new site assessments and adopting
new design standards taking into account projected increasing flood risks;
● Incorporating flood protection measures into plant design for protecting the key
infrastructures such as intake structure, power house, etc.;
● Increasing dam height and existing spillway discharge capacity wherever
permitted structurally;
● Further enhancing flood management plans with precision real-time monitoring
and early warning systems;
● Continuing development of integrated reservoir inflow and flood forecasting for
the downstream area;
● Enhancing satellite-based monitoring for hydro and thermal power plants;
● Continuing basin-wide management strategies that take into account the full
range of downstream environmental and human water uses may prove
necessary;
● Restoring and better managing and use at upstream catchments such as
afforestation to reduce sedimentation;
● Implementing Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) approach to ensure
Sustainable Hydropower Dam Safety Management
Some of the potential dry spell adaptation measures for thermal power plants include:
● Installing monitoring systems on source water supplies and develop standard
operating procedures for low water conditions;
● Ensuring proper design of cooling water intake and discharge systems;
● Enlarging or retrofitting cooling systems such as water-saving cooling
technology to overcome water stress issues;
● Diversifying energy sources and/or the inclusion of supplemental technologies
that are less dependent on water for cooling purposes;
● Incorporating climate change factors into site assessments to avoid siting new
plants in water-stressed areas;
● Promoting demand management and end-use energy efficiency measures
4.11.8 Public Health Sector
Healthcare Facilities
The increased focus on WASH in healthcare facilities to support The Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) 2030 Agenda, particularly the SDG6 on clean water and
sanitation, has raised concerns over the issues and uncertainties related to basic
services. The timely development of WASH at healthcare facilities was to track the
SDG3 on good health and well-being, which targets to reduce maternal, newborn and
child mortality.
However, due to the limitation of data, estimations of WASH in healthcare facilities
cannot be conducted nationwide. As a result, infrastructure improvements
incorporating climate resilience such as water conservation, waste minimization and
low-carbon energy are often overlooked by the stakeholders.
In order to be more robust towards more frequent extreme weather occurrences,
specific climate risks of each WASH provision should be identified and prioritized for
to further improve these services in healthcare facilities. Broad expertise primarily to
address and strengthen WASH at different healthcare facility levels is required.
Vector Borne Diseases
The projections and assessments on climate-health outcomes are rather complex
consisting of some degrees of uncertainty in terms of interaction between the cycles
of disease with humans, ecosystems and environmental drivers.
Dengue infection, for example, has no particular therapy. There is still no highly
effective and safe quadrivalent dengue vaccine to curb dengue transmission. Some
current strategies and new approaches to manage the epidemic may include
digitalization of dengue tracking approach, virtual monitoring of dengue patients,
sustainable vector control activities, and community empowerment and mobilization
to create and maintain dengue free environments. Periodical revision of dengue
clinical practice guidelines (CPG), training for medical practitioners, and periodical
refresher courses for ground staff, have to be continuously carried out and upgraded.
Developing an effective vector control for anopheles’ mosquitoes is the biggest
challenge in controlling the knowlesi malaria. Innovative science and technology on
vector control for knowlesi malaria is therefore of the highest priority. Improved intersectoral collaboration is required in order to develop a more integrated effort to control
the spread of the zoonotic malaria. Annual training on the implementation of malaria
elimination program is required at all levels to enhance the knowledge and skills in
managing malaria. Integrated Vector Management Course, International Malaria
Vector Surveillance for Elimination Course and External Competency Assessment for
Malaria Microscopists, are among the jointly organised courses organised by the MOH
with the WHO, APMEN and ACTMalaria.
FWBD and Leptospirosis
Although the impacts of extreme weather on communicable diseases transmission,
especially FWBD and leptospirosis, have been studied in this country, the relationship
between climatic factors and the diseases occurrence has yet to be fully understood.
There are also some uncertainties in the precise consequences of climate change on
the disease’s transmission, since other domains are also contributing to the
transmission including various ecological drivers (such as land use and urbanisation,
pollution and waste management), and socioeconomic factors. All these factors need
to be taken into consideration in disease surveillance and environmental health
exposure risks reduction.
There is a need to improve the current diagnostic methods and criteria to support early
intervention toward better prevention and control of FWBD. Digitalisation of disease
surveillance will provide real-time data analysis and acts as an early warning system.
Multi-ministries and enhanced societal approaches are required to reduce food
poisoning and typhoid cases. Updating current and developing new guidelines on
FWBD is also part of the strategies for improvement of surveillance, prevention and
control. Ongoing training on outbreak management involving stakeholders at national,
state and district level is crucial in FWBD prevention and control activities.
Hotspot mapping of leptospirosis cases in recreational areas by the MOH will enable
public to take preventive measures. Community empowerment and mobilization in
cleaning high risk areas for rat infestation is also necessary to reduce leptospirosis
cases. Revision of leptospirosis guidelines and standard operating procedures is
required at regular interval, as part of the standards and strategies for surveillance,
prevention and control of leptospirosis. Training for medical practitioners on
leptospirosis management is also essential.
Heat Related Illness
Various climate projection models conducted in other countries have indicated a range
of health implications of heatwaves. Therefore, local researchers must address the
uncertainties in terms of climate effect (such as emission scenarios and variations in
urban heat island) and population effect (such as population demographic, population
adaptation and acclimatization, and urbanization) raised during the development of
temperature-health effect relationship before applying those projections in Malaysia.
The impact of extreme temperatures on health among the Malaysian population still
has much to be discovered especially in establishing the association between extreme
temperatures and heat-related illness. Furthermore, the primary determinants of cases
are also uncertain. Specific research on the vulnerable groups is therefore required.
Understanding the association between extreme temperatures, heatwaves and heatrelated illness will enable proper assessment of climate change impact, which will help
to strengthen the adaptation policies and actions.
The MOH has made progress in terms of capacity building based on the available
guidelines in clinical management of heat-related disease and public health response
to heatwaves. Areas that require urgent improvement include professional
engagement with the community for public education and awareness, data
management for evidence-based decision making, and emergency response at all
levels of the organization for risk and impact reduction.
5. RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION
5.1
Introduction
Addressing climate change should be based on the best available scientific knowledge
and consideration of national circumstances. Malaysia recognised the urgency and
has prioritised scientific research, long-term systematic monitoring and data collection
for informed policy directions to undertake the necessary response measures.
5.2
Research
Over the past decade, research institutes, universities, NGOs and the private sector
had continued with their respective research activities on mitigation and adaptation
amidst the dire warnings and bleak scenarios contained in successive assessment
reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Funds for this
research were primarily from national sources.
5.2.1 Regional Climate Modelling
Climate modelling is an important tool to support the development of science-based
adaptation and mitigation measures. This systematic approach will help the country to
develop and implement policies and measures that ensure climate-resilient
development.
In Malaysia, climate modelling is carried out at the National Water Research Institute
of Malaysia (NAHRIM) and the School of Environmental and Natural Resource
Sciences of the National University of Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,
UKM) in collaboration with the Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia).
UKM is leading the lower resolution Southeast Asia regional climate modelling
collaboration among ASEAN countries through the SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA
programme while NAHRIM leads the higher resolution climate modelling work for the
country.
5.2.1.1 South East Asia Climate Downscaling
The Southeast Asia Climate Downscaling (SEACLID) collaboration started in 2010
among seven countries with funding from the Asia-Pacific Network (APN) for Global
Change Research. This project was subsequently integrated into the Coordinated
Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), an international regional
climate downscaling initiative that is coordinated by the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP) and renamed as SEACLID/CORDEX Southeast Asia. In addition
to the core objective of producing and providing a new generation of regional climate
downscaling based on fine-scale climate projection for the region, the
SEACLID/CORDEX project also serves as a platform to advance climate sciences
through capacity-building workshops for young scientists from the region. The platform
has also created opportunities for regional scientists to connect to a broader
international scientific community.
The first phase of SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA was completed in 2018 with the successful
downscaling to 25 km x 25 km resolution from 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs) runs with 7 Regional Climate
Models (RCM) using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5.
Malaysia’s contribution to these runs was based on the RegCM4 model. The project
has also successfully established the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Change
Information System (SARCCIS), a data portal for sharing CORDEX-SEA data with
Climate Change and Renewable Energy (RU-CORE), Bangkok, Thailand is a data
node of the Earth System Grid Federation. The CORDEX-SEA climate projection data
has enabled 25 peer reviewed papers to be published by the researchers in Southeast
Asia of which three were specifically centered on future precipitation variations in
Malaysia while another two examined the hydro-meteorological droughts in specific
river basins in Malaysia.
The second phase of the project started in 2018 and is centred on downscaling to a
higher resolution of 5km x 5km grid. The projection runs for Peninsular Malaysia has
been completed while the runs for Sarawak and Sabah are on-going. The research
outcomes from these runs would be reported in the next communication.
5.2.1.2 Regional Hydroclimate Modelling for Malaysia
NAHRIM’s climate projection for Malaysia utilised the WRF (Weather Research
Forecasting) model to dynamically downscale coarse resolution CMIP5 climate
projection data of the GCMs to a much finer spatial grid resolution of 6km over
Peninsular Malaysia (WRF-PM) and Sabah-Sarawak (WRF-SS) regions. This
dynamical downscaling allowed the impact of local topography, local land surface and
land use conditions on the local climates of the regions be taken into account. The
downscaling was carried out using projections from 5 GCMs for RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and
8.5.
A total of 16 future climate projections were carried out for the period 2006 to 2100
with historical control runs from 1970 to 2000. Bias corrections were performed for the
dynamically downscaled 16 future climate projections. This resulted in 16 x 94-year
future climate realisations at a fine resolution over the regions compared to 5 x 30year downscaled historical realisations from the control runs of the 5 GCMs. The
output had been used for the vulnerability and adaptation assessment reported in
5.2.1.3 City-Scale Modelling
With the concentration of population into urban areas, assessment of changes in the
urban climate through city-scale climate projections modelling becomes critical in
strengthening the resilience of cities against the impacts of climate change. Equally
important is the ability to predict city-scale weather extremes using very fine scale
numerical models for effective disaster risk management. As a first step towards this
and the Atmosphere Ocean Group of the Department of Applied Mathematics and
Theoretical Physics of the University of Cambridge implemented a Disaster Resilient
Cities trial project centred on Forecasting Local Level Climate Extremes and Physical
Hazards for Kuala Lumpur. The project was supported by the Newton-Ungku Omar
Fund, under the administration of the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High
Technology (MIGHT) and Innovate-UK.
The project involving 6 UK partners and 10 Malaysian partners across diverse sectors
was targeted to improve city-scale weather forecasting and reduce losses associated
with natural hazards in Kuala Lumpur. However, the usefulness of such applications
would require improvements in the very fine scale prediction model, in particular the
surface and boundary layers physics including urban heat island effect and urban
landscape canopy. Research work on these aspects is being carried out at the
universities.
5.2.2 Coastal Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities of the country’s long coastline of 8,840km continue to gain attention as
these regions are vital economic zones and population centres.
5.2.2.1 Sea-Level Rise
Sea level along the Malaysian coastline displays a multi-scaled response to local and
remote forcing agents. Malaysian tide gauges and neighbouring altimeter records,
aggregated monthly, had been analysed to characterise the seasonal to interannual
variability in four regions: along coastlines facing the Malacca Strait (Western
Malaysian Peninsular), the Sunda Shelf (Eastern Malaysian Peninsular), the South
China Sea (Western Sarawak and Sabah) and the Sulu and Celebes Seas (Eastern
Sabah).
Understanding the impacts of sea-level rise is crucial in assessing the 11th
vulnerability of the country’s vast coastal regions. Through funding under the 11th
Malaysia Plan, NAHRIM has updated the sea-level rise projection and these results
were used for vulnerability assessments presented in Chapter 4 of this report.
The projection of sea level rise took into account future contributions from changes in
ocean density and circulation with additional contributions from the loss of mass from
glaciers, the surface mass balance and the dynamic response of the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets and changes in land-water storage as evaluated in the IPCC AR5.
The projection was developed using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models that were also used in the IPCC AR5 together with
models and data representing the contributions from glaciers, the Greenland and
Antarctic Ice Sheets, global terrestrial water storage and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment.
The study evaluated value of sea-level rise increment and range, anomaly of
uncertainties using multi regression analysis and enhanced analysis of past seasonal
and interannual sea-level variability and rise around the coastline of Malaysia.
5.2.2.2 Sea Surface Temperature
During this reporting period, NAHRIM has carried out an analysis of the sea surface
temperature trend around South China Sea and adjacent region using the NOAA
0.25°×0.25° Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) dataset based
on the simple linear regression of the yearly averaged SST from 1982 to 2021. Most
parts of water around Peninsular Malaysia recorded a warming trend of 0.10.15°C/decade, except over the southern peninsular where the warming rate is
~0.2°C/decade. The warming rate over Sarawak coastal water is 0.1-0.15°C/decade,
whilst that over the Sabah coastal areas is slightly higher at 0.15-0.20°C/decade.
5.2.3 Water Resources
Malaysia is paying close attention to the vulnerability of its water resources to the
impacts of climate change. Under the 11th Malaysia Plan, NAHRIM has undertaken
several studies through fine-scale modelling to produce projections of the impacts of
climate change on the hydrological regime and water resources of Malaysia.
Two primary studies had been completed namely the extension study of the Impact of
Climate Change on the Hydrologic Regime and Water Resources of Malaysia (Phase
2) and the Impact of Climate Change on the Hydro-Climate of Malaysia based on IPCC
AR5 for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. A third study focusing on drought
is on-going and would be completed in 2022.
NAHRIM has also developed the Climate Change Adaptation Framework for the water
sector focusing on water resources, utilisation and risks associated with climate
change which will be instructive in the development of the National Adaptation Plan.
5.2.4 Agriculture
Research in this sector focuses on the vulnerabilities of key crops to the changing
rainfall patterns, temperature rise and floodings. Therefore, studies were carried out
to discover drought- and flood-tolerant traits of the various crops. In the livestock subsector, research efforts were focusing on the development of enteric fermentation
country-specific emission factor for the various cattle breed.
5.2.4.1 Oil Palm
In NC3, the effects of rainfall and temperature on growth and yields of oil palm for
nearly three decades were reported. A recent canopy scale modelling study on oil
palm in peatland demonstrated that palms were exerting significantly greater stomatal
control at deeper water table depths (WTD) and the optimum WTD for photosynthesis
was found to be between 0.3 and 0.4m below the soil surface. Raising WTD to this
level from the industry typical drainage level of 0.6m could increase photosynthetic
uptake by 3.6% and reduce soil surface emissions of CO2 by 11%. Site study further
showed that despite being poorly drained compared to other planting blocks at the
same plantation, monthly fruit bunch yield was, on average, 14% higher.
5.2.4.2 Rice
Since 2015, Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI)
through its Paddy and Rice Research Centre and Agrobiodiversity and Environment
Research Centre have conducted various studies on varieties that can be grown under
drought conditions. These efforts include assessing current varieties as well as
developing new ones (with drought-tolerant traits).
Cultivation of rice under drought conditions involves the growing of rice with
supplemental irrigation, without the necessity for maximum standing water in the field.
Early studies showed that the current rice variety, MARDI Siraj 297, could be cultivated
under limited or saturated water conditions. The results showed that maintaining an
irrigation system in saturated conditions did not cause significant reduction of the plant
physiological performance. The saturated condition was able to sustain similar soil
moisture content required by the plants as in flooded conditions.
In addition, studies have also identified a local specialty rice variety, MRQ 76, of having
drought-tolerant traits that can be introduced to farmers in non-granary areas that are
water stressed.
Under the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), the research will be further strengthened
through pilot scale studies and field assessments in areas prone to the impacts of
climate change.
5.2.4.3 Rubber
A model had been developed to assess the impacts of climate change on rubber
cultivation. The model took into account particularly on the rainfall patterns and
temperature rise on the maturity on the growth and latex production. The result from
this study had been used to develop adaptation strategies for the sector. In addition,
research to develop climate resilient clones is ongoing.
5.2.4.4 Cocoa
Research work was undertaken by the Malaysian Cocoa Board (MCB) on the impacts
of climate change on the crop yield. Twenty-four commercial cocoa clones were
screened for their drought and flood tolerance traits and classified according to their
respective tolerant levels. Further field test would be required to refine the findings.
An 11-year observation of ant colonies in cocoa plantations against temperature and
rainfall patterns were analysed. The result indicated reduction in ant colonies with
increase in temperature. Ants are important to control cocoa pod borers outbreak in
the plantations.
5.2.4.5 Livestock
Under a technical assistance from the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural
Greenhouse Gases (GRA) and the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas
Research Centre (NZAGRC), a workshop has been conducted by NZAGRC
researcher in Malaysia with an objective to improve the country’s inventory reporting
for ruminant livestock subsector, through implementation of IPCC tier-2 methodology
in the enteric methane emission estimates. Initially, a set of country-specific emission
factors were developed based on Brakmas, which is a local beef cattle breed. The
emission factors developed had been used for the GHG Inventory reporting. Work is
on-going to develop the enteric fermentation emission factor for Elite KK, another local
beef cattle breed.
5.2.5 Forestry
A long-term Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) research is being
undertaken to assess the impacts of elevated CO2 in an inland forest (Tekam
Permanent Reserved Forest, Jerantut, Pahang). This study will quantify the effect of
elevated CO2 on the productivity of lowland forest which is managed under the
Sustainable Forest Management. Outputs from this study will be used to develop
adaptation measures for the forestry sector.
5.2.6 Tropical Peatland
Disturbance to peatlands which are critical reservoir of greenhouse gases has gained
huge international attention in the fight against climate change. In 2016, the Sarawak
Tropical Peat Research Institute (TROPI) was upgraded from the Tropical Peat
Research Laboratory (TPRL) to advance research in tropical peatland. Research work
at TROPI is centred on GHG inventory emission inventory from peatlands and forests,
carbon stock, carbon dynamic, pedo-hydrology, soil and water chemistry, plant
nutrition and soil fertility, forest tree inventory, environmental microbiology and plant
pathology.
At TROPI, GHGs flux are measured using two common methods, the chamber-based
(manual and automated chambers) and the eddy covariance method. Manual
chamber method is used to measure the soil GHG fluxes, and TROPI has been using
this method since the establishment of TPRL in 2008 to measure soil CO2, CH4 and
N2O fluxes. Automated chamber method is now being used to measure soil CO2 and
CH4 fluxes continuously since 2014.
TROPI uses the eddy-covariance technique, a micrometeorological technique for
direct measurements of gas exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. In
2010, eddy covariance flux towers were set up in three different ecosystems in
Sarawak: (a) a peat swamp forest located at Maludam National Park, (b) a secondary
peat swamp forest and (c) an oil palm plantation. Measurements are made above the
tree canopy at 41m height in both peat swamp forest and secondary peat swamp
forest, while measurements are made at 21m height for oil palm plantation. In 2017,
the secondary peat swamp forest was converted into an oil palm plantation. Thus, the
measurement height was changed from 41m to 21m. The CO2 fluxes, sensible and
latent heat fluxes, and meteorological measurements have been measured since
2011, while the CH4 fluxes measurement started in September 2012, in collaboration
with the Hokkaido University and the National Institute for Environmental Studies
(NIES), Japan.

5.2.7 Public Health
Climate change can exacerbate existing health issues or create new public health
challenges through a variety of pathways from extreme weather episodes to spread of
certain diseases. In recent years, the Institute for Medical Research (IMR) which is the
bio-medical research wing of the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) has kept up with
research on climate-related health threats.
Evidence from local research on climate change impacts to human health has
increased considerably over the past few years. However, focus on certain disease
burden and the linkages with climate change need to be explored further where
international collaboration is essential. Health Research priorities under the 12th
Malaysia Plan (2021 – 2025) has outlined two focus areas: climate change and
climate-sensitive diseases; and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment
including during extreme weather events.
5.2.7.1 Vector-borne Disease
Dengue
Malaysia has conducted extensive studies in various aspects of dengue infection.
These include epidemiological surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, clinical
management, and entomological surveillance studies.
Research of dengue outbreak and its relationship with land use in the most populated
state of Selangor were carried out since 2014. The land use effect mapping using
Local Moran I analysis was used to study agriculture, stagnant water bodies, housing,
industry, open land and drainage in four districts. The study was able to identify
location of hotspots for dengue fever in relation to each type of land use.
In addition, Artificial Neural Networks architecture (ANNs) was applied for prediction
of number of dengue cases per week in the district of Klang using previous week
reading of weekly mean rainfall, mean temperature, mean relative humidity and
infection cases. The results serve as early warning, pin-pointing to the most likely
vectors breeding sites.
The ANN prediction model was also used to predict weekly dengue cases, patients’
serology and patients’ dengue fever type with input of meteorological and clinical
parameters with considerable accuracy which contribute towards better understanding
of outbreaks and development of prevention and control measures.
Projection of dengue transmissions with climate as a driving force based on the IPCC
AR5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) was made for two districts in
Peninsular Malaysia - Petaling in Selangor and Johor Baru in Johor – for the period of
1970 to 2100. The projected dengue cases in the district of Petaling following the
RCP8.5 scenario is four-fold of that projected under the RCP4.5 scenario meanwhile
the district of Johor Baru showed less sensitivity to the magnitude of the temperature
change. This study would provide the basis for policy makers to develop adaptation
strategies in management of dengue fever to cope with the impacts of climate change.
Entomological research on the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia (a bacterial endosymbiont
of arthropods) provides promising option as a tool for dengue control, particularly in
very hot climates. Releases of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the wAlbB strain
were carried out in six diverse sites in Greater Kuala Lumpur with high endemic
dengue transmission. The strain that could block dengue virus transmission into
population of the primary vector mosquito, Ae. Aegypti was successfully established
and maintained at very high population frequency at some sites or persisted with
additional releases. Based on passive case monitoring, reduced human dengue
incidence was observed in the release sites when compared to control sites. Several
articles on this subject have been published. However, the research is currently
ongoing in order to provide evidence-based decision-making in vector control.
Malaria
Studies on Plasmodium knowlesi, the emerging species for malaria in Malaysia has
applied geographical data and ANN to forecast malaria cases. Significant
environmental factors – elevation, water bodies, rainfall, land surface temperature and
normalised difference vegetation indices - were used as input for the ANN analysis.
Infection by this species contributes to almost half of all malaria cases and deaths
particularly in the Borneo region. The malaria susceptibility index and zoning analysis
revealed that regions near Sabah’s Crocker Range and in the eastern part of Sabah
were more vulnerable to P. knowlesi infections.
A study on the epidemiology of malaria in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018 highlighted the
threat posed by zoonotic malaria to the National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan.
Although Malaysia did not record any indigenous cases of malaria caused by human
malaria parasites for the first time in 2018, there was nonetheless an increase in P.
knowlesi infections that year with a total of 4,141 cases reported.
While P. knowlesi infection can be attributed to a variety of factors, more than half of
cases were linked to agriculture and plantation activities, with a large proportion of the
remaining cases linked to forest-related activities.
5.2.7.2 Food and Water-borne Disease
Research on food and waterborne diseases in Malaysia has been conducted to
evaluate the association of meteorological parameters and post-extreme weather
events (such as flood) to the outbreak trends. The hot and humid climate along with
poor sanitation and inadequate water supply during flooding, creates an opportunity
for the transmission of food and waterborne bacteria leading to a public health risk.
The association between temperature and precipitation with food and water-borne
diseases were also documented by a study which found that the odds of having
cholera cases increases by a factor of 3.5 for every 1˚C increase in temperature.
Although prevalence of diarrheal diseases has reduced in the past decades, increased
rain and flooding have increased the occurrence of the diseases. This was shown
following the major flood in Kelantan in 2014, in which 14.2% of confirmed typhoid
fever were found to be related with the event. The collapse of infrastructures following
the massive flood caused disruption to hygiene and sanitation services, creating an
ideal environment for typhoid fever transmission. Additionally, a significant increase in
enteric pathogen isolates particularly Salmonella sp were registered during the postflood period.
5.2.7.3 Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is an emerging disease, especially in countries with a tropical climate
such as Malaysia. This was attributed to the large number of reservoir animals,
suitable humid and moist environment for proliferation as well as abundant forest
resources.
Current studies suggested the influence of extreme weather and climate change in
this zoonotic disease. There are increase risk of human exposure as the frequency of
flooding increased in recent years. In East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, leptospirosis
showed an increased in reported cases following a massive flooding event in 2014.
Understanding the spatial distribution and associated factors of leptospirosis can help
improve future disease outbreak management in relation to flood events, including to
help in identify localities with a strong environmental or socio-demographical
determinants for leptospirosis transmission.
Current studies showed positive association of leptospirosis cases with heavy rainfall
and flooding in Malaysia. With projected precipitation and flooding in increasing
frequency and greater intensity, these may potentially drive the surge in leptospirosis
incidence and outbreaks. Further research is required to understand the
environmental drivers and climate change hazard risks viz-a-viz population dynamics
towards strengthening emergency preparedness and adaptive capacity.
5.2.7.4 Heat-Related Illness
The future increase of temperature as a result of climate change combined with the
humidity profile in Malaysia is expected to threaten the population’s health and
economy. Impact of extreme temperature and heatwave to human health can be either
direct heat related illness or indirect health impacts such as cardiovascular and
psychological impact.
Studies on heat related illness have been made deploying various methodologies from
basic epidemiological approach using survey to modelling and other statistical
downscaling cluster approach survey.
However, there are some complexities to determine health impacts of extreme high
temperature particularly in urban micro-climate. Urban heat island effects and air
pollution could compound the effects of global warming, making the urban population,
a vulnerable group. People with respiratory diseases, the elderly, and women were
the most vulnerable groups when it came to the effects of extremely high
temperatures.
Cases of heat-related illness have been reported in Malaysia which showed the
severity of the illness. However, there was limited research on the prevalence of heatrelated illness among the general population. Most of the studies were done on
environmental heat exposure at work such as among traffic police, solid waste
management workers, and farmers which showed a significant occurrence of heat
related illness. Besides common symptoms of heat related illness such as heat
exhaustion and heat syncope, exploration of other symptoms such as psychosomatic
pain, psychological anxiety, and somatization-related symptoms have shown to be
significantly associated with heat stress in recent studies conducted in Malaysia.
More research needs to be conducted to examine all aspects of the impact of heat
and extreme temperature in Malaysia. Studies on vulnerabilities and adaptative
capacity especially among vulnerable and sensitive populations are still lacking.
5.2.7.5 Non-communicable Respiratory Diseases
Studies in this area were conducted on the health effects of transboundary pollutants
as a result of regional forest fires during prolonged dry months which had become a
recurring phenomenon since the 1980s, with the worst episode in 1997. Significant
increase in natural and respiratory mortality were registered among Klang Valley
residents as a result of exposure to hazy days, with higher risks of respiratory mortality
than natural mortality.
5.2.8 Energy
The key research entities of the energy sector have made some significant
achievements in the deployment of renewable energy technologies particularly in the
field of solar and biogas energy. Improvements were also made on carbon capture
and utilisation technologies to decarbonise coal plants operation.
5.2.8.1 Renewable Energy Research, Development and Deployment
The TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. (TNBR) and SIRIM Bhd. (SIRIM) has continued their
respective research efforts in the development of renewable energy technologies to
suit local conditions. Several innovative technologies were successfully developed
and deployed.
Palm-based Bio-energy
Research to harness the biogas potential in the oil palm sector has gained momentum
and significant outcome. SIRIM has developed a 200 mmbtu/day bio-compressed
natural gas production plant in Tawau, Sabah to demonstrate the feasibility of
utilisation of Compressed Bio-as (CBG) from palm oil mill effluent for land transport
and industry usage. Palm oil millers in Sabah have started to use compressed biomethane gas in their trucks. The construction of the first CBG pipeline in Johor with a
capacity of 1,000 mmbtu/day was started in late 2020 and is scheduled for completion
by end of 2022. The barrier to a smooth supply chain of CBG is also being overcame
with the development of Type 4 Light Weight Composite Cylinder in addressing the
storage and distribution challenge.
Meanwhile, TNBR has developed a Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP) system to reform
biogas. Three different conditions were developed namely, (i) for biogas with low
calorific value the NTP reforms the biogas into higher hydrocarbons to provide enough
energy for power generation; (ii) separation and capturing of CO 2 in the biogas that
can be used for co-combustion with CH4 to increase heat generation; and (iii) to reform
the biogas by dissociating CO2 to CO, combining it with radicals from dissociated CH4,
to produce value-added chemicals such as methanol, which can be used as liquid fuel
for vehicles.
Solar Thermal and Its Application
SIRIM has carried out various Solar Thermal Application Projects in various industries
such as poultry farming, food and beverages, downstream agricultural productions and
the hospitality sector. The application in solar water heater which is one of the energyguzzling electrical appliances that is widely used throughout the country has a huge
potential to switch the electricity dependence from fossil fuel to solar energy.
SIRIM is also looking at the potential of Solar Thermal System for power generation
by using Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). In supporting development in this field,
SIRIM has collaborated with UNIDO to develop the UNIDO/SIRIM Standard which
provides requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used
to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FSPV) System
To address the challenge of land constraint on the deployment of solar energy, TNBR
has conducted feasibility studies on floating solar farm. This project aimed to
determine the feasibility of constructing a grid-connected photovoltaic system on water
surfaces and assess the economic value. The research project found that the energy
generation of the FSPV is higher than solar PV installation on the ground due to the
cooling effects of the water body. The actual module temperatures were significantly
less than the average values of ground-mounted solar PV systems. In conjunction with
the findings, the project developed a 108 kWp FSPV system at the Sg. Labu Off-River
Storage (ORS) in the state of Selangor. Annually, the 108kW grid-connected FSPV
system will be able to produce 137.97 MWh of energy. Experience from this project
would enable the scaling-up of the FSPV system to other Off-River Storage (ORS)
reservoirs.
A second test site at disused coal ash ponds yielded favourable results. Further
experiments are being carried out on hydro dam reservoirs and offshore waters.
Hydro Turbine System Innovation
TNBR has made significant improvement on the impulse hydro turbine system using
the new innovation impulse turbine bucket. Innovation was also made on the nozzles
of the conventional Pelton turbine. The innovation was patented as Bahari Impulse
Hydro Turbine (BIHT). The efficient, highly flexible and cost-saving design of BIHT
could generate electricity from 5kW to 600MW, thus increasing the potential for the
development of run-of-the-river hydro-electric plants throughout the country especially
in remote areas.
5.2.8.2 Decarbonisation of Coal Plants
Since NC3, TNBR has continued its experiment and research on carbon capture and
utilization (CCU) technologies at existing power plants. Two projects at the CCU
Research Station in TNB Janamanjung power plant have yielded strong potential for
adoption and scaling-up.
Microalgae with Enhanced CO2 Fixation
A new nutritional mode which led to higher growth of a local microalgae species was
discovered thus greatly improved the fixation rate of carbon dioxide (CO 2) of the
organism. This is the first pilot Algae Bio-CCU technology in Malaysia tested with
actual flue gas from a live coal-fired power plant.
Amine-Based Technology for Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU)
The ideal solvent was discovered for the amine-based gas cleaning system that has
vastly improved the absorption rate of CO₂. The technology and solvent aided in
reducing the reboiler duty, temperature and related operational costs.
5.2.9 Greening of Industrial Park
The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) through its agency, SIRIM has
initiated a research program to streamline the development of Eco-Industrial Park
(EIP). The primary objective of the study is to facilitate the transformation of existing
industrial parks (IPs) towards Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) based on the international
best practices as documented by World Bank Group, UNIDO and GIZ. Malaysia has
adopted the definition of EIP as “A community of manufacturing and service
businesses located together on a common property. Member of businesses seek
enhanced environmental, economic and social performance through collaboration in
managing environmental and resource issue.”
The adoption of the eco-industrial parks concept which embodies the circular economy
model will be made a pre-requisite for the development of new industrial parks.
Existing industrial parks will also be encouraged to adopt the model, by promoting
collaboration among tenants in these parks in managing resources and environmental
issues efficiently. Industry players will be required to adopt the Environment, Social
and Governance (ESG) elements in their business practices. An industrial standard is
currently being developed to establish the prerequisites and performance
indicators/criteria of EIP which are based on these ESG principles.
The research program will assist the park managements and tenant companies to
benchmark their performances against a set of EIP criteria; assessing the tenant
companies for the baseline efficiency on the resource utilization, identify industrial
symbiosis opportunities which will then be turned into business model and finally
acknowledging some of the core industrial parks as potential EIP; deserving technical
and financial assistance to enhance its productivity and better promotion package to
encourage sustainable investment into the EIP.
5.3 Systematic Observation
Monitoring of climate change and assessment of its impacts are conducted by several
frontline technical governmental agencies and departments. Meteorological
parameters are monitored by two key agencies, the Malaysian Meteorological
Department (METMalaysia) and the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID).
METMalaysia gathers meteorological data from its nationwide network of weather
stations while DID collects rainfall data and monitor water level of river basins for its
hydrological observation. Observational networks and the sensors used have evolved
since their early days in line with the technological changes.
Other agencies such as the Slope Engineering Division of Malaysian Public Works
Department (PWD) and Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan (PLUS), the concessionaire
of the north-south axis highway of Peninsular Malaysia also carried out rainfall
observations at hilly region and along the tolled highways respectively.
Monitoring in the biodiversity and natural ecosystem are reported through the national
reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Forest Resources
Assessment (FRA) which focuses on the baseline status and trends. The assessments
contained in these reports have indirect information on climate change impacts.
5.3.1 Climate Observation
Malaysia continues to operate a network of weather, climate and global atmospheric
watch stations for systematic and long-term data collection.
i. Weather and Climate Observation Stations
The METMalaysia operates a network of 43 principal meteorological stations, most of
which are located at the airports. The Department operates a further 200 automatic
auxiliary weather stations, 34 climatological stations and 150 rainfall stations which
are located within the compound of public hospitals and clinics, government buildings
at states and district levels, schools and plantations. These weather stations measure
a large variety of different meteorological parameters: air temperature; atmospheric
pressure; rainfall; wind speed and direction, humidity; sunshine hour and solar
radiation. Changes of the climate in Malaysia are assessed through long-term records
of these established efforts. A 30-year average of a station’s weather observations is
traditionally used to determine the local climate.
ii. Upper Air Stations
The department also operates eight upper air observation stations. Each station
releases two meteorological sonders per day in order to get the atmospheric vertical
profile information, such as the wind condition, air temperature and air humidity up to
50 km above the ground.
iii. Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Stations
As a member of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Malaysia participates
in the world body’s Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) programme since 1989. Under
this programme, Malaysia has established a network of GAW monitoring stations that
carries out systematic monitoring of atmospheric constituents to study and understand
the regional issues on transboundary haze, acid deposition, climate variability, climate
change and stratospheric ozone depletion.
The country currently operates a global GAW station at Danum Valley, Sabah and
three regional GAW stations at:
Tanah Rata, Cameron Highland;
METMalaysia Headquarters at Petaling Jaya, Selangor; and
Bachok, Kelantan
The Regional GAW station at Bachok was set up in 2014 in collaboration with the
University of Malaya (UM), the University of East Anglia and the University of
Cambridge and is operated by the UM’s Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences. The
station’s location over the coast of eastern Peninsular Malaysia allows studies of land
sea atmospheric circulation, ocean air interactions and coastal uplifts. In collaboration
with the National Environmental Research Council of the United Kingdom, this station
is also a part of the Global Methane Measurement Network since 2016.
The types of observation made at the GAW stations are shown in Table 5.1 below.

Malaysia also operates a vertical profile ozone monitoring station at Sepang, Selangor
where ozonesondes are released twice monthly. This data is shared with the World
Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) and the Southern Hemisphere
Additional Ozonesondes (SHADOZ) network.
5.3.2 Hydrological Observation and Flood Warning System
The DID started implementing telemetric water level and rainfall observations in the
major river basins following the 1971 big flood. These programmes have since been
expanded to smaller rivers and as of 2021, a total of 99 river water level and 626
rainfall stations and 455 combine stations (rainfall and water level) along the river
basins had been installed.
DID has also installed flood siren systems in some of the smaller river basins in the
urban areas where flash flood occurs frequently. In these river basins there is little lead
time available for effective warning. Hence flood warnings sirens are automatically
trigger to warn the residents of an impending flood once the water level reaches a
critical point.
Since 1980, flood warning notice boards have also been erected in the major river
systems. There are three categories of warning board which are for monsoon flood,
flash flood and the combination flood.
5.3.3 Drought Information & Warning System
DID initiated the drought monitoring programme since early 2001 to provide drought
information. The early warning system was established following the 1998 drought
incident which affected a large number of residents in the Klang Valley. A web portal
was developed with the aim to communicate drought information to relevant
stakeholders to trigger early preparation for drought events.
As of 2022, the programme is supported by 17 dam level stations, 55 river water level
stations at gauging site and 183 rainfall stations which provides information about the
real time situation on storage in dam and river flows as well as rainfall data.
5.3.4 Sea-Level Monitoring
Sea level rise is monitored by the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia
(JUPEM) which began as the Tidal Observation Project dating back to the Fourth
Malaysia Plan (1981-1985).
To date, a total of 21 tide gauge stations, 12 in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah (5)
Sarawak (3) and one station in Labuan forms the Tidal Observation Network to provide
the precise mean sea level values for the establishment of the new Precise Levelling
Network for Peninsular Malaysia where all the tide gauges stations are connected to
each other through a network of precise levelling lines.
With the recorded tidal data, JUPEM is able to obtain sea level rise trend through time
series analysis from the date of establishment of the tide gauge station.
5.3.5 Forestry
Forestry authorities has kept up with long-term monitoring efforts of the health and
function of the various forest ecosystems in the country which would provide
invaluable insights into the impacts of climate change. Such long-term data collection
is vital towards the development of both mitigation and adaptation measures.
5.3.5.1 National Forest Inventory
The Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia conducts a 10-year-interval forest
inventory in Peninsular Malaysia since 1972. Efforts are being made to implement
similar programme in Sabah and Sarawak in a consistent manner and to align the
exercise across all three geographical regions. A Malaysian Forest Inventory Report
will be produced by 2025.
5.3.5.2 Eddy Covariance Flux Measurement
Eddy covariance techniques is used for long-term quantification of gas exchange rates
by directly measuring turbulent flux in the near surface atmosphere above an
ecosystem and thus also above the soil surface. It is used to estimate the exchange
of carbon dioxide, heat and water vapour as well as methane and other trace gases.
The eddy covariance flux measurements are conducted in forests and oil palm
plantations. The monitoring station in the inland forest at Pasoh started in 1998. In
year 2010, Sarawak Tropical Peat Research Institute (STROPI) set-up three eddy
Covariance flux towers in three different ecosystems in Sarawak: (i) a peat swamp
forest located at Maludam National Park, (ii) a secondary peat swamp forest and (iii)
an oil palm plantation. The CO2 fluxes, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and
meteorological measurement in all sites has been done using eddy-covariance
method since 2011 while the CH4 fluxes measurement was started in September
2012.
5.3.6 Coral Reefs Monitoring
Coral reefs are an important ecological and economic resource in Malaysia, providing
a range of valuable ecosystem services to many people. Based on Reef Check
Malaysia’s coral reef monitoring data collected from over 150 permanent survey sites
from 2007 to 2021, Malaysia’s coral reefs are in ‘Fair’ condition, recording an average
44.44% live coral cover (hard coral cover + soft coral cover) over the past 15 years.
Abundance of fish and invertebrate indicators remains generally low suggesting either
historical or on-going fishing pressure. Numerous indicators of disturbance (recently
killed coral, coral rubble and silt) and pollution (nutrient indicator algae and sponge)
highlight ongoing concerns about the trajectory of coral reefs health. Indicators of
disturbance are mainly recorded in North Borneo region (Sabah) while indicators of
pollution are mainly recorded in Sunda Shelf region (East coast of Peninsular Malaysia
and Sarawak).
The Crown-of-Thorns (CoT) starfish is an important predator of coral. While it does not
appear to be a threat in most places, there are some sites where CoT abundance is
an issue that needs attention, especially in Sunda Shelf region. Every year except in
2014, the abundance of crown-of-thorns starfish in Sunda Shelf region is above what
a healthy coral reef can support (0.2-0.3 individual per 100m2).
Narrowing it down to eco-regions (an area of relatively identical species composition,
clearly distinct from adjacent regions), the health of coral reefs in the North Borneo
and Malacca Strait regions has remained more or less the same over the past 15
years. From 2018 onwards, coral reefs in the Malacca Strait region show improvement
as reduced disturbance indicators allow coral reefs to improve. The health of coral
reefs in Sunda Shelf region on the other hand shows some variation. From 2015 to
2020, coral reefs in Sunda Shelf have deteriorated. In 2021, the coral reefs show
improvement. The improvement is mainly attributed to recovery of coral reefs in
Terengganu following damage caused by Tropical Storm Pabuk in January 2019.
Available substrate for coral recruits to attach to is high, indicating possible chance of
further coral reefs recovery if human impacts and crown-of-thorns starfish populations
are dealt with.
Climate-related impacts to coral reefs are increasingly evident during reef surveys.
The three main impacts to coral reefs of climate change are:
i.
Bleaching: higher than normal water temperature causes corals to expel
microscopic algae that usually live in their tissues, algae that are an important
source of nutrients for the coral. This gives the coral a “bleached” appearance.
Coral can survive in this condition for several weeks but if the warm water
persists for longer corals will die. As the oceans continue to warm bleaching is
likely to become more frequent and, as the time between bleaching events
reduces the likelihood of widespread coral die-off increases. Warm water coral
reef bleaching is often observed during surveys.
ii.
Acidification: the oceans absorb a significant proportion of the CO 2 emitted by
human activity. This causes the ocean to become more acidic. This in turn
affects the chemistry of the ocean, particularly the carbonate cycle. As a result,
organisms that create calcium carbonate shells or structures (including shellfish
and corals) are less able to do so, increasing the likelihood of damage or
predation.
iii.
Storms: storms are becoming stronger and more frequent. Storms can affect
corals in shallow water as wave action breaks corals. This was evident following
storm Pabuk, which hit the Terengganu islands in early 2019 causing significant
damage to shallow reefs (which was reflected in survey data).
To counter the effects of climate change, there is a need to build the “resilience” of
coral reefs so that they are as healthy as possible and thus more likely to withstand or
recover from climate-related impacts.
5.3.7 Public Health
The Ministry of Health has implemented a number of programs and activities to
monitor certain communicable and environmental diseases that are directly or
indirectly related to climate change. To improve population health in an unstable and
changing climate, the resilient healthcare system includes a climate-sensitive disease
surveillance system as well as capacity building of health personnel to enhance their
response and readiness capabilities to the health impacts of climate change.
5.3.7.1 Vector-Borne Diseases
Dengue is one of the mandatory notifiable diseases by medical practitioners in
Malaysia under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342)
and the National Strategy Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control Program (20212025). The monitoring of dengue is available through the real time web-based dengue
surveillance systems notably the e-Notification, e-Dengue and Dengue Outbreak
Management System. There is also a sentinel surveillance of circulating dengue
serotype via Dengue Virus Serotype Surveillance Program by National Public Health
Laboratory and IMR.
Malaysia has reported zero indigenous cases of human malaria since 2018 and
successfully sustained this status for four consecutive years. Therefore, Malaysia has
ended the National Strategic Malaria Elimination Plan in 2021. Nevertheless,
numerous new strategies have been implemented to prevent malaria re-introduction
to the country which include malaria re-introduction risk stratification and risk mapping.
An online risk mapping code-named MAGICs.ME is one of the new strategies for
malaria prevention, preparedness and response plan.
5.3.7.2 Food and Waterborne Disease
There are five food and waterborne diseases on the list of communicable diseases
which are required to be notified under the Prevention and Control of Infectious
Diseases Act 1988. These are Cholera, Typhoid/Paratyphoid fevers, Viral hepatitis A,
food poisoning and Dysentery.
5.3.7.3 Communicable Disease
Leptospirosis becomes notifiable under the Prevention and Control of Infectious
Diseases Act 1988 [Act 342] since 2011. The implementation of control and prevention
of leptospirosis include four strategies which are:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
enhanced surveillance and sharing of information;
coordinated multi-agencies prevention and control activities;
risk reduction; and
research and development.
5.3.7.4 Heat Related Illness
Heat related illnesses are a wide spectrum of disease ranging from heat oedema to
heat stroke. Other heat related illnesses include heat exhaustion, heat cramp, heat
syncope and heat fatigue. Monitoring of heat related illnesses were developed and
carried out since 2016 where hospital-based data such as hospital admissions and
mortalities due to heatwave were regularly collected.
5.3.7.5 Non-communicable Respiratory Diseases
Monitoring of diseases related to haze through sentinel clinics were developed since
1998. In 2020, there are a total of 65 sentinel clinics to monitor the trend of upper
respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis and asthma during poor air quality periods.
In addition to the monitoring by the sentinel clinics, hospital-based data such as
hospital admissions and mortalities of respiratory, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular
and other chronic diseases are also collected on a regular basis.
5.3.8 Air Quality Monitoring
The Department of Environment (DOE) under NRES and the Natural Resources and
Environment Board (NREB) under the Sarawak Government are the two key agencies
responsible to monitor air quality in Malaysia. A total of 65 automatic and 14 manual
stations were installed throughout the country in carrying out this task. Monitoring is
also further enhanced with one unit of mobile environmental air quality station placed
in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak respectively. In addition, NREB operates
five Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) that are able to detect PM2.5 in Tebedu,
Lubok Antu, Lawas, Lundu and Bario with the objective of monitoring the occurrences
of haze.
The observed near real-time air quality data such as Air Pollution Index (API) are
shared
through
their
websites:
http://apims.doe.gov.my/home.html
and
https://www.nreb.gov.my respectively.
The air quality monitoring components at the 65 DOE's stations are PM10, PM2.5,
ground level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The API
is calculated based on the concentration of these 6 major components.
6. CAPACITY-BUILDING, EDUCATION, PUBLIC AWARENESS, INFORMATION
SHARING AND NETWORKING
6.1 Introduction
Interest and attention on climate change continue to grow within the government,
research institutions, private sector, civil society organisations and general public
since NC3.
At the policy-making level, the government has enhanced its focus on addressing
climate change as illustrated through continuous mainstreaming of mitigation and
adaptation elements into the relevant development policies.
Awareness raising and capacity-building efforts among government agencies and key
state-owned enterprises in the energy sector saw a significant increase. Workshops
and lectures on climate change have become regular feature of these awareness
activities to enhance climate change knowledge among their personnel.
The financial and capital sector over the past few years has taken a keen interest on
climate change and had carried out a series of awareness programme among its
members from regulatory body to private banks and institutional investors.
Civil society organisations with their varied and specific expertise continue to play an
active role in increasing the overall awareness and responses of Malaysia in facing
the climate change phenomena.
Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the spate of climate-related
disasters around the world, local media interests were heightened on the importance
of international cooperation to address climate change. Media coverage was focused
on key global events such as the annual COP and meetings of statutory bodies of the
UNFCCC, the IPCC and the United Nations General Assembly’s programme on
climate change.
6.2 Capacity-building
Relevant government agencies overseeing key emissions sectors have stepped up
their respective capacities to meet the periodic reporting requirements of the UNFCCC
as well as the dual climate actions in mitigation and adaptation.
6.2.1 Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Malaysia continues to build its institutional capacity in applying the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines in the preparation of its GHG
Inventory, enabled by regional and local trainings especially in the energy, IPPU,
AFOLU and waste sectors. These efforts were made possible through the UNFCCC’s
workshops and the annual WGIA, an initiative of Japan via its NIES. In addition, the
UNFCCC had provided training for a GHG Inventory review expert.
In the energy sector, TNBR which is the research arm of the country’s primary utility
company TNB, has conducted training for its personnel to better understand the IPCC
methodologies with the aim to develop the CO₂ and non-CO₂ emission factors by flue
gas for the electricity sub-sector. The expertise acquired were shared with TNB’s
power plants personnel across the country. This initiative will also contribute towards
enhancing the quality of data collection in the long-run and enable the energy sector
GHG Inventory calculation to move to a higher tier.
Another sector where emphasis was made with regards to expertise in applying IPCC
methodologies is in the agriculture sector, particularly in the livestock sub-sector.
Personnel from the MARDI were trained on the procedures for higher tier estimation
of GHG emissions from livestock.
6.2.2 Mitigation
Key agencies implementing mitigation-related efforts are building on their existing
training programmes to enhance the capacity of their personnel to ensure the
continuity and successful outcomes of those efforts.
6.2.2.1 Energy
In the promotion of renewable energy, the SEDA has continued with its human capital
development training programmes in the area of both grid-connected and off-grid
photovoltaic system design, installation and maintenance courses. In recent years,
TNBR has also followed suit in strengthening the distribution system by rolling out gridconnected photovoltaic design courses covering PV modules, inverter and associated
equipment suitable for Malaysia climate conditions.
In addition, SEDA has also extended its grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) design
course to academia and government agencies to enlarge the pool of expertise in this
field. To further enhance the workforce for the renewable energy sector, it has reached
out to the low-income group and indigenous communities to participate in GCPV
installation courses. SEDA has also engaged the Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry
Association in terms of regulatory knowledge, policy direction, technology
development and business outlook.
Capacity-building to enhance biogas as another important renewable energy source
was also provided by SEDA through training courses in the operation and
maintenance of biogas power plant at the operator and supervisory levels.
In support of the NEEAP (2016-2025), courses on energy audits and energy
management continue to be conducted by both SEDA and TNBR. In the last four years
since NC3, these courses had trained hundreds of energy managers and
professionals in measurement and verification from more than a hundred
organisations.
Meanwhile, in the construction industry, the CIDB has also continued to produce
certified facilitators and assessors through its Malaysian MyCREST programme. This
programme helps in the design, construction and operation of energy efficient
buildings.
6.2.2.2 Forestry
In implementing the National REDD plus Strategy, capacity and awareness of various
stakeholders were enhanced particularly at the sub-national level with technical
support from national agency. In addition, Sabah Forestry Department also conducted
capacity-building activities to implement its REDD plus strategy.
With rising temperature, changing rainfall patterns and the associated potential for
prolonged dry spell, the risk of forest fires incidences is anticipated to increase.
Therefore, the forest management protocol has to incorporate forest fire management.
The forestry departments have conducted training on fire prevention and control to
enhance preparedness for forest fires.
6.2.3 Adaptation
6.2.3.1 Climate Modelling and Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment
The Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling (SEACLID) and the Coordinated
Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) SEACLID/CORDEX climate
modelling initiative presented the research outcomes of its phase one at its final
workshop in 2018. Malaysian researchers from universities and research institutes
participated in the workshop that enabled them to acquire knowledge on climate
projection that would enable them to utilise the projection results for sectoral
vulnerability and adaptation assessments.
NAHRIM has carried out several capacity building programmes in regional climate
change modelling for Malaysia as well as V&A assessment for the targeted groups of
relevant stakeholders.
Between 2018 and 2020, NAHRIM carried out climate modelling for the three regions
of the country using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 dataset by
employing dynamical downscaling for 16 realisations under five Global Climate Models
and the four Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios of the IPCC
Assessment Report 5. It has also completed the sea level rise study for the three
regions using statistical downscaling based on 29 Atmosphere-Ocean General
Circulation Models (AOGCMs).
In addition, NAHRIM has conducted specific capacity building programmes to
strengthen the expertise of officers in assessment of climate vulnerabilities in water
resources, sea level rise, sea surface temperature and saltwater intrusion. NAHRIM
has produced the Climate Change Adaptation Framework for the water sector which
provides strategic planning options to address adverse impacts of climate change and
increase sectoral resilience.
NAHRIM has also embarked on V&A training through the development of Malaysia
Adaptation Index (MAIN), which summarises the level of vulnerability and readiness
of each state in facing the impacts of climate change.
The APEC Climate Centre (APCC) under its Young Scientist Support Program also
provided trainings on climate projection downscaling and its applications for V&A
assessments.
6.2.3.2 Disaster Risk Reduction
Workshops and training to strengthen linkages between disaster risk reduction and
climate change was led by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Southeast Asia Disaster
Prevention Initiative (SEADPRI-UKM) in collaboration with multiple partners under the
aegis of NADMA Malaysia.
With support from the Newton Ungku Omar Fund, SEADPRI-UKM also collaborated
with the City Hall of Kuala Lumpur to build the capacity of multi-disciplinary
researchers to develop a multi-hazard platform for forecasting climate hazards at the
city level. A series of workshops on disaster resilient cities were held to create
awareness and enhance understanding among academia, policy-makers, government
officers, disaster management personnel and NGOs involved with disaster
management on the use of the climate hazards platform for disaster risk reduction.
With funding from International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC),
SEADPRI-UKM and the State Government of Selangor convened events
promoting social entrepreneurship for disaster risk reduction and climate change, to
build community resilience. The focus was on strengthening science, technology and
innovation that bridges near term climate hazards to long term slow onset and
emerging threats at the local level.
6.2.3.3 Agriculture and Food Security
In anticipation of adverse climate impacts on food production, agriculture researchers
and officers participated in various training programmes to equip themselves with
available tools, skills and knowledge. Researchers were exposed to various climate
resilience technologies and practices through capacity-building programmes by
international bodies for ASEAN member states.
The Department of Agriculture of Peninsular Malaysia continued its promotion of Good
Agriculture Practices (GAP) with a focus on erosion controls for vegetable and fruits
farmers. Outreach were made to a few thousand farmers and students through
exhibitions, leaflets and symposiums. A demonstration plot on erosion control and field
training on soil conservation techniques were among the hands-on initiative carried
out.
GAP were also implemented by the oil palm and kenaf plantation industries. The
Malaysian Palm Oil Certification Council (MPOCC) provided training on sustainability
practices for over 45,000 oil palm smallholders under the national mandatory
certification scheme.
MARDI is also spearheading rice genetic research and cooperation with other riceproducing ASEAN members as a climate resilience solution for this staple food.
6.2.3.4 Infrastructure
PETRONAS, the national oil and gas company, has been building internal capacity
and raising awareness on climate hazards. This has enabled them to use Geographic
Information System (GIS) to compile critical information to assess climate
vulnerabilities of its operation and assets to climate change and develop an adaptation
plan.
Over the same period TNBR had also been developing the capacity of its staff to carry
out V&A assessments of the country’s electricity infrastructure including existing coalfired power plants operated by TNB, with the aim to develop an adaptation guideline
to enhance the resilience of these assets.
The Ministry of Health has developed a checklist to assess the vulnerability and
resilience of its health facilities across the country.
6.3 Education
Climate change education saw increased interests within the public sector in the past
few years. Meanwhile, dissemination of information and knowledge on climate change
continues in both formal and informal environmental education through the schools’
and higher education institutions’ curriculum and extra-curriculum activities.
6.3.1 Formal Environmental Education
The Ministry of Education has incorporated climate change in the geography syllabus
of secondary schools as well as in language and science subjects. About 200 teachers
from the 13 states and three federal territories were picked to attend the Training of
Trainers course. They would in turn replicate the course and pass on the knowledge
to 11,775 geography teachers throughout the country’s secondary schools.
6.3.2 Informal Environmental Education
The Ministry of Youth and Sports Malaysia has actively engaged youths in impactful
programs, aligning with the nation's climate action goals. Initiatives like Rakan Bumi:
3R@Community, Eksplorasi Alam, Rakan Bumi: Plogging@Community, Program
Tanam Pokok, Penanaman Bakau and Program Tanam Pokok Sempena LTdL have
been conducted which emphasize (i) Empowering youths to champion environmental
awareness and eco-friendly practices; (ii) Fostering community cohesion and
environmental consciousness among younger generations; (iii) Encouraging ecoconscious habits, fitness activities and conservation initiatives among youth; (iv)
Cultivating a deep appreciation for diverse flora and fauna experiences; (v) Instilling a
sense of responsibility and environmental stewardship through hands-on activities; (vi)
Providing youth-centric fitness programs tailored to different districts; (vii) Elevating
youth awareness about the importance of biodiversity and green spaces (viii) Inspiring
a profound connection to nature through tree-planting campaigns; (ix) Aligning with
climate objectives via initiatives like 'Friend of Earth Program: LTdL Tree Planting
2023; and (x) Involving youths in coastal preservation efforts and promoting
sustainable tourism
The Environment Protection Department of Sabah has implemented the Friends of the
Environment programme among schools in the state since 2003 to inculcate
environmental awareness among the schooling population. Activities of the
programme is jointly organised with the State Education and Forestry Departments as
well as the Sabah Wetlands Conservation Society.
The Climate Change Institute of the National University of Malaysia (Institut
Perubahan Iklim, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) organised public lectures to raise
awareness among undergraduates, researchers and general public on climate change
and its impacts. It also reached out to coastal communities to impart information on
sea level rise.
The corporate sector has also stepped up its informal environmental education in
tandem with the increase in Corporate Social Responsibilities programmes among the
private sector. SWCorp, a waste management corporation has developed training
module for the establishment of recycling clubs in both primary and secondary
schools. The programme reward participating schools through competitions. The
campaign is also extended to the tertiary education institutions.
Sime Darby Plantation, a corporation from the oil palm plantation sector, under its
Sime Darby Foundation’s Young Sustainability Ambassador programme collaborates
with FRIM in inculcating environmental awareness among youth via nature camps.
FRIM also provides the corporate sector an avenue to implement greening activities
through its tree-planting initiative.
SEDA raised awareness of the sustainable energy agenda of the country through its
magazine called ‘Sustainable Energy Malaysia’ which is distributed to its stakeholders
such as ministries, government agencies, embassies, financial institutions and key
industry players.
6.3.3 Research Community
To enhance the research capacity and output of academicians, the Academy of
Science Malaysia (ASM) held seminars and workshops centred on the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report and played a role in linking local scientists’ engagement with the
IPCC’s process.
In addition, several workshops and dialogues were also convened by ASM to enhance
the engagement of local scientists in the IPCC Sixth Assessment cycle of the IPCC.
The Academy also held several events to disseminate recent findings of the IPCC to
early career researchers and youths.
6.3.4 Public and Corporate Sector
As a key emissions source, the energy sector represented by state-owned enterprises
TNB and Petronas are acutely aware that they need to beef up awareness internally
and lead by example. Both entities are actively assessing and disclosing their
operational impacts in terms of carbon footprints through their annual sustainability
reports besides holding regular lectures to sensitise their respective personnel. TNB’s
initiative is supported by training on carbon footprints assessment provided by its
subsidiary, TNBR, across TNB’s operating entities.
Special attention was given to growing energy consumption in the information and
communications technology (ICT) sector by SEDA. In 2017, SEDA initiated the Data
Centre Baseline and the Telecommunication Baseline studies. SEDA also coordinated
the Energy Audit Conditional Grant under the 11th Malaysia Plan for commercial
buildings to adopt energy management and conservation measures.
In the port and shipping industry, two ports have introduced sustainable practices in
their attempts to reduce emissions and green their operations. Kuantan Port, for
example, is developing a GHG inventory reporting on its operation and exploring wave
energy with Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia.
The Ministry of Health continues to educate its personnel on climate change and its
impacts especially in the area of management of public health during climate-related
disasters. It has conducted a workshop among its personnel on the vulnerability and
adaptation assessment of climate related health effects. The workshop focused on the
linkage between climate and health at specific locations, as well as an assessment of
the factors influencing vulnerability. It would serve as the foundation for adaptation
plans to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience to climate change.
The Town and Country Planning Department has introduced the concept of Green
Neighbourhoods to encourage municipalities and city councils to incorporate
mitigation and adaptation elements into their spatial plans.
6.4 Public Awareness
6.4.1. Public Participation
Awareness on climate change among general public is best strengthened by direct
participation of the targeted communities.
To enhance the knowledge of the National REDD Plus Strategy, the Sabah Forestry
Department conducted a series of workshops to raise awareness of the mechanism
and encourage participation of the community in the Lower Kinabatangan River
corridor. The workshops involved nearly 200 representatives from the riverine villages.
Under its MySuria project launched in 2017, SEDA has enabled 332 selected poor
households to instal solar rooftop and participate in the Feed-in-Tariff mechanism for
a 10-year period. Each family were able to generate an additional RM250 per month
by selling electricity to the national grid. In its implementation, SEDA collaborated with
regional economic development authorities such as the Northern Corridor
Implementing Agency of the Northern Corridor Economic Region. SEDA also
implemented two solar PV projects with the state government of Selangor’s Smart
Selangor programme – a GCPV project for a low-cost flat dwelling and an off-grid PV
project in an indigenous village.
To increase the visibility of the country’s renewable energy adoption efforts, a buildingintegrated PV (BIPV) was installed above the walkway linking the National Cancer
Institute and Hospital Putrajaya which allowed the public to appreciate the effort via a
display screen showing the real-time performance of the BIPV system.
To reduce emissions from the waste sector, waste management company SWCorp
has rolled out a series of waste minimisation initiatives ranging from recycling bank,
upcycling and a “No food wastage during Ramadhan” campaign since 2017.
NAHRIM has continued with its community-based awareness programme on sea level
rise through seminars and workshops to equip targeted communities with knowledge
and observation skills.
Civil society organisations in Malaysia also played their parts in raising awareness of
climate change via their respective programmes. In the past years, World Wide Fund
– Malaysia continued with its annual flagship Earth Hour Campaign by collaborating
with the city councils of Melaka, Petaling Jaya and Penang. It also expanded its climate
agenda via the One Planet City Challenge, a biennial competition that aims to
recognise and reward cities for developing low carbon and climate-resilient solutions.
The Malaysian Youth Delegation, set up in 2015, continued to lead the climate
movement among young Malaysians by offering the opportunity to participate as youth
delegates at the annual UNFCCC Conference of Parties. It prepared the participants
by exposing them to national and international climate policies through dialogue
sessions with respective experts from the government and non-governmental
organisations.
Other non-governmental organisations like Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), Malaysian
Nature Society (MNS) and Global Environmental Centre (GEC) had maintained a longstanding engagement with local communities and schools through their respective
environmental awareness programmes. In the case of MNS and GEC, partnerships
were also forged with the private sectors. A key feature of their programmes is treeplanting activity especially in mangrove and peat swamp areas.
In the marine ecosystem, Reef Check Malaysia continues its monitoring of the health
of coral reefs at over 200 sites each year with volunteers’ help.
The Third World Network (TWN) which tracked the UNFCCC’s negotiation process
provided its perspectives on the international policy-making space at public forums
and the media.
6.4.2 Early Warning System and Disaster Preparedness
As extreme weather events increase over time, development of early warning system
and disaster preparedness gained importance to protect lives and properties among
vulnerable communities.
The DID provides information on floods, rainfall, river water level and associated flood
risks, flood cameras, drought by river flow and drought by dam to the public through a
web portal. DID also provides warnings and advice on risk of floods through the
national television during the yearly northeast monsoon season.
For communities located close to the frontline of vulnerable infrastructure such as
dams, TNBR has embarked on a programme to sensitise local communities including
indigenous villagers living close to hydro power stations operated by its parent
company TNB. The programme includes evacuation drills involving hundreds of
residents and villagers. It has also produced a guidebook on disaster relief
management to better coordinate response procedures with non-governmental
organisations.
Besides floods, DID also disseminate information on water resources status as early
warning on potential drought. The web portal, http://infokemarau.water.gov.my,
provides a real time monitoring of drought conditions and a two-month advanced
prediction.
Flood warnings efforts of DID is complemented by the Public Works Department’s
disaster management website that provides latest information on disasters such as
floods, landslides, collapsed roads, sunken roads, damaged/collapsed bridges, and
others. Apart from disaster information, it also informs public on the status of flood
operation rooms.
6.4.3 Green Financing
The financial and capital market sector has embarked on a series of awareness raising
campaign to educate bankers, institutional investors and insurers on the importance
of adopting sustainability in their operation and greening their investments portfolios.
Capital Market Malaysia, Malaysian Association of Asset Managers and Aberdeen
Standard Institutional Client and Institutional Investors Council were active in
organising seminars and talk to promote sustainability ranging from corporate
sustainable reporting to greening capital market products. In its series of Thematic
Sustainability Workshop, Bursa Malaysia Berhad (formerly known as the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange) has raised awareness on exposure to climate risks, role of
the financial sector towards the transition to a low carbon economy.
As the leading authority on sustainable energy, SEDA too played its part in the
Malaysian Green Financing Taskforce (MGFT) initiated by the Securities Commission
of Malaysia. MGFT’s objective is to develop an ecosystem that will support the growth
of a viable and sustainable green economy.
SEDA also contributed to the Renewable Energy Value based Intermediation
Financing and Investment Impact Assessment Framework (VBIAF) Sectoral Guide
Working Group of the Bank Negara (Central Bank) in 2019 which serves as reference
or financial institutions intending to incorporate environmental, social and governance
(ESG) risks consideration in their own risk management system.
Apart from helping to mainstream the green economy through green product and
service expansion, the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation
(MGTC) continued its advocacy on energy efficiency, renewable energy, low carbon
urban infrastructure and lifestyles in particular on low carbon mobility through
programmes such as the International Greentech and Eco Products Exhibition and
Conference Malaysia (IGEM).
6.5 Information Sharing and Networking
Collaboration to address the challenges of climate change has continued at the
international and regional level. Malaysia’s networking in climate actions cover the
areas of energy, industrial processes, agriculture, low carbon cities.
At the UNFCCC, UNDP and GCF level, Malaysia’s policy-makers were able to build
their capacities in key areas of climate actions such as climate finance, adaptation,
REDD Plus implementation, development of Nationally Determined Contributions and
Enhanced Transparency Framework. The latter two areas are vital aspects towards
implementation of the Paris Agreement which gained momentum after it came into
force in November, 2016.
Various capacity building efforts in support of the implementation of Paris Agreement
were also conducted at the bilateral level between Malaysia and foreign entities such
as German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), National University of
Singapore, National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan and the European
Capacity Building Initiative.
Since 2012, the country’s lead agency for sustainable energy, SEDA, has organised
the International Sustainable Energy Summit (ISES). The biennial event gathered the
international community in the field of sustainable energy to share the latest
knowledge and policies and accelerate transformation of the energy sector to achieve
the collective climate goals.
In 2018, SEDA represents Malaysia in the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic
Power System Programme Executive Committee. The representation enabled
Malaysia to further develop its solar PV industry and scale-up adoption of the
technology. Besides IEA, SEDA also represents Malaysia at the International
Renewable Energy Agency.
At the ASEAN level, the country has been in active collaboration with the ASEAN
Centre for Energy in the area of energy management. Malaysia is an active participant
of the ASEAN Minister of Energy Meeting and the Senior Officials Meeting on Energy
which are key political platform for regional cooperation on energy. Malaysia held the
chair of the Renewable Energy Sub-sector Network (RE-SSN) since 2009 and the
chairmanship was helmed by SEDA between 2012 and 2019. Malaysian companies
were keen supporters of the ASEAN Energy Awards (AEA) initiative that was launched
in 2000 to promote awareness on best practices in energy efficiency and conservation
in buildings, industries and energy management, renewable energy, and clean coal
technology.
The iron and steel industry of Malaysia has strong engagement at the regional level
by participating in forums and conferences promoting and exchanging solutions to
green the industry. As a member of the South East Asia Iron and Steel Institute, the
Malaysian Iron and Steel Industry Federation (MISIF) participate in the annual
ASEAN-Japan Steel Initiative which seek to enhance cooperation on energy saving
and environmental protection for a sustainable steel industry.
In the field of agriculture, Malaysia has participated in the Climate Smart Agriculture
course with a focus on rice cultivation organised by the ASEAN Secretariat and
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan.
Another collaboration related to energy efficiency is in the field of the production of
highly-efficient LED through the Gallium nitrate-on-Gallium nitrate (GOG) between
researchers from two public and one private university in Malaysia and researchers
from the University California of Santa Barbara.
As Malaysia experience rapid urbanisation, it is keen to adopt low carbon city
strategies. Since 2017, 19 municipality and city councils have participated in the
Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative.
Under the FAO’s Gulf of Thailand (GoT) Large Marine Ecosystem initiative, the
Department of Fisheries is participating in the activity of building the resilience of the
marine ecosystem in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.
The Asian Network on Climate Science and Technology (ANCST) coordinated by
SEADPRI-UKM continued to facilitate collaboration and exchange of information
between researchers engaged in scientific and technological aspects of climate
change and climate-driven disasters specific to Asian conditions and phenomena.
With seed-funding from the Cambridge Malaysian Education and Development Trust
and Malaysian Commonwealth Studies Centre (CMEDT/MCSC), ANCST has
convened about five events annually with multiple institutions involving researchers,
policymakers, private sector practitioners and early career researchers. The reach of
ANCST includes providing inputs relevant to the tropics to global institutions such as
the IPCC, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the
International Science Council (ISC).
The Sabah’s Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Environment collaborated with the
Conference of Earth Environment from Akita (CEEA), Japan in a multi-year public
awareness raising programme on climate change. Two workshops were organised
under phase One of the collaboration from 2016 to 2019 involving students, teachers,
parents and local community members.
6.6 Gender Participation
In line with the Enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender (LPWG) and its gender
action plan4 which calls for women’s full, equal and meaningful participation in the
international climate process, the Committee conducted 97 engagements as part of
the NC4 process in the form of meetings, workshops, trainings and consultations
involving a total of 1,699 people (959 women; 750 men). Moreover, approximately
42% of women held technical positions (Table 6.1) in the national climate change
technical committees and working groups, namely the Technical Committee on
Climate Change, Technical Working Group on GHG Inventory, Technical Working
UNFCCC.

Malaysia continues to build awareness on climate change issues, and in doing so tries
to actively engage women in these initiatives. Between 2017 and 2019, ministries,
government agencies, public institutions and corporations conducted a variety of
Capacity Building, Education, Public Awareness, Information Sharing, and Networking
(CEPAIN) initiatives on climate change awareness (see Table 6.2).

Slightly more than half (53%) of the initiatives organised for the public sector saw
female participation rates of 50% and higher. Events with lower numbers of female
participation were reflective of industries with traditionally low numbers of women,
such as technical fields within forestry such as carbon stocks, climate financing, GIS
mapping; agricultural management; and clean energy adaptation. Similarly, none of
the initiatives organised for actors within the private sector (n=14) exceeded 50%
participation of women in industries such as agriculture, transportation management,
and construction, nor did trainings that involved communities.

6.6.1 Gaps and Opportunities
The gender profile of Malaysia as well as the main climate change trends, policies and
programmes in Malaysia provides a data set for each sector, but little to no nexus is
made by either of the sectors. Information that is available through sporadic and ad
hoc studies point towards the negative impacts of climate change on the basis of
gender5,6,7 but also indicate a low understanding of the link between environmental
sustainability and gender equality, to cultural and social norms. The sectors working

on climate change have not yet taken the specific needs, experiences and knowledge
of women and men into account to inform a gender-responsive approach to climate
change.
This is the first time that Malaysia has tried to address and incorporate gender issues
into the national communication process guided by the UNDP Toolkit on Gender
Responsive National Communications and other relevant UN tools and
methodologies. In line with the LPWG, Malaysia has identified several indicators under
each of the Priority Areas that will guide its focus in developing a holistic genderresponsive approach moving forward, namely:
Priority area A: Capacity building, knowledge management and communication

7. CONSTRAINTS, GAPS, LEVEL OF SUPPORT RECEIVED AND NEEDS
7.1 Introduction
This chapter is an updated summary of the Constraints, Gaps, the Level of Support
Received and Needs as reported in Chapter 4 of the Fourth Biennial Update Report
whereby the details can be found in the chapter titled Level of Support Received,
Constraints, Gaps and Needs.
Financial, technical and capacity building support from international sources were
received by federal and state agencies from multilateral and bilateral sources to
implement climate change actions.
7.2 Constraints and Gaps
Challenges remain in implementing Malaysia’s commitment to address climate
change and its impacts. Some of the challenges were identified by the Team of
Technical Experts (TTE) during the International Consultation and Analysis of
Malaysia’s Third BUR.
7.2.1 GHG Inventory and GHG Emission Projection
For GHG inventory and emission projection, the challenges include the development
of country-specific emission factors, improvement of activity data collection, and longterm modelling tools for projections. Estimating GHG emissions and removals from
some categories are constrained by incomplete or lack of activity data and most
categories lack country specific emission factors.
For BUR3, the TTE in consultation with Malaysia identified a need for capacity-building
that could facilitate the Party’s transition to the enhanced transparency framework
under the Paris Agreement, namely enhancing the national capacity for future scenario
analysis, including factor analysis and decomposition analysis at the sectoral level.
As stated in BUR4, Malaysia is continuing to improve its institutional arrangement,
activity data collection, analysis and archiving for its GHG inventory. Efforts are being
concentrated on improving the disaggregation and completeness of the activity data
according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and developing country specific emission
factors for the key categories. A National GHG Inventory Improvement Plan for
emission factors is being implemented under the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025),
however capacity building is still needed for realising these plans.
7.2.2 Mitigation
Quantification of mitigation outcomes continues to be a challenge especially when
policy measures do not address GHG emissions reduction. Improvement in the
accounting methodologies for all the sectors (energy, IPPU, waste, agriculture and
LULUCF sectors) could be further enhanced.
Implementation of mitigation actions requires access to suitable cost-effective
technologies. At the current moment, access to cleaner technology remains a
constraint, hence mitigation opportunities are limited especially for the IPPU sector.
For the agriculture sector, mitigation opportunities are restrained by the need to
prioritise food security and livelihood of farmers. Despite these challenges, policy
measures are being developed especially for the energy and IPPU sectors in order to
guide Malaysia’s NDC implementation and pathway towards net-zero emissions as
early as 2050. The Securities Commission, Central Bank and Bursa Malaysia require
companies and financial institutions to incorporate ESG into their reporting of
sustainability. These actions include the role of carbon markets, the adoption of new
technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and the enhanced usage
of nature-based solutions to reduce emissions. The waste sector has already set
ambitious targets for recycling.
7.2.3 Adaptation
The constraints and gaps for vulnerability assessment and adaptation measures had
been presented in detail for each of the sectors in Chapter 4. While vulnerability
assessment has become a periodic routine, capacity buildings to increase the
expertise of the personnel involved in the climate projection, vulnerability assessment
and adaptation needs identification and implementation is required. To this end,
Malaysia is in the process of getting approval for financial support from GCF to develop
a comprehensive National Adaptation Plan.
7.3 Level of Support Received
The main source of international financial support is through the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF), one of the two operating entities of the UNFCCC’s financial mechanism
from cycle 1 to 7 (June 1994 to June 2022). The funding provided by GEF, other
multilateral agencies and bilateral sources were channeled through specific projects.
Under GEF cycle 4 to 7 (June 2006 – June 2022), Malaysia was allocated an indicative
sum of USD43.7 million and utilized USD38 million which was used to develop the
country’s institutional and technical capacity on the reporting obligations to the
UNFCCC as well as the implementation of mitigation actions. These actions were
facilitated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD).
Financial support through GEF-6 and GEF-7 cycles were primarily used to build up
technical and technological capacities in transport, energy, forestry (including
peatland), low carbon cities and community empowerment projects.
The amount of funding provided by GEF for NC4 was USD500,000. It should be noted
that in the preparation of BUR4 which was submitted to the UNFCCC on 31 st
December 2022, the allocation of USD352,000 from GEF for BUR3 was used. This
was made possible as the balance from BUR2’s allocation was used to prepare BUR3
which was submitted on 31 December 2020.
The other UNFCCC’s financial mechanism operating entities, the Green Climate Fund
(GCF) has provided readiness support for Malaysia to identify energy sector
prioritisation project, potential direct access entity and enhance its implementation
framework to access results-based payment for the forestry sector.
Other significant financial assistance is in the area of adaptation from the United
Kingdom with the allocation of £875,000 to develop capacity in forecasting local level
climate extremes and physical hazards as well as community level outreach for the
city of Kuala Lumpur.
In the area of capacity-building, Malaysia received a fairly wide range of trainings
between 2017 and 2019. Trainings in the areas of GHG inventory, mitigation
(measurement, reporting and verifying emissions data), adaptation planning,
implementing and enhancing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), climate
negotiations, climate finance and Article 6 and 13 of the Paris Agreement were
provided by the UNFCCC’s Consultative Group of Experts, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, GCF, various multilateral organisations as well as from
Annex I and non-Annex I Parties such as the European Capacity Building Initiative,
Japan International Cooperation Agency, the German Agency for International
Cooperation (GIZ) and the China-ASEAN workshop organized by China.
At the sub-national level, the states of Johor and Melaka have received capacitybuilding from the United Kingdom Prosperity Fund’s Future Cities Programme and the
Japanese Joint Crediting Mechanism’s City to City Collaboration for Building Energy
Monitoring and Reporting System.
7.4 Needs
Malaysia is only beginning to report on its progress on NDC implementation and
additional technical capacity-building and financial assistance would be needed to
develop systems to track its NDC implementation and cooperative approaches (Article
6 of the Paris Agreement).
Needs for external financial, technical/technology and capacity-building support in the
thematic areas of GHG inventories, mitigation and adaptation had been identified by
the proponent agencies and nationally agreed upon through workshop consultations
and reviewed by the Technical Working Group on Finance and Needs as well as
endorsed by the National Steering Committee on Climate Change. These has been
detailed in the BUR4 report.
An estimated amount of USD2.25 million in international funding is required for GHG
inventory improvement. To implement the identified mitigation actions, major financial
support is required by the iron and steel industry to the tune of over USD46 million.
For adaptation, a preliminary estimate of USD63.6 million is required for various
initiatives to enhance resilience measures throughout the country.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The completion of Malaysia’s Fourth National Communication was made possible with
the contributions, knowledge and expertise of many local scientists, experts and
individuals from various governmental agencies, research organisations, nongovernmental organisations, universities and industry organisations. Various
consultative meetings and workshops have been conducted in support of the
Technical Working Groups and thematic Sub-Working Groups. The final report was
sent to the relevant Ministries, Agencies, Industry Organisation, Academia and NGOs
for their review and comments. An editorial team was also set up to consider the entire
report before its finalisation.
