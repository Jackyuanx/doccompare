MITIGATION MEASURES
Thailand has made efforts to uphold its commitment under the Convention by
integrating climate change mitigation into its national and sectoral policies and plans
and implementing mitigating measures in order to achieve the national GHG reduction
targets—NAMA’s target to reduce GHG emissions by 7-20% from BAU by 2020 and
NDC’s target to reduce GHG emission by 20-25% from BAU by 2030. Thailand submitted
the 2nd updated NDC, which aligns with an ambitious pledge to reduce GHG emissions
by 30% from the BAU level by 2030. The contribution level increases to 40%, subject
to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial
resources, and capacity-building support. Furthermore, Thailand will continue efforts to
meet the long-term goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero GHG emissions
by 2065.
Thailand implemented NAMA’s mitigation measures and successfully achieved a GHG
reduction of 56.54 MtCO2eq in 2020 from 10 mitigation measures in the energy and
transport sectors which is 15.40% lower than its BAU level. As NAMA ended in 2020,
Thailand has transitioned toward NDC, which aims to reduce GHG emissions in the
energy, transport, industrial process and product use, and waste management sectors.
In addition, Thailand has also increasingly developed supporting measures and
voluntary actions to mitigate GHG reduction, such as the carbon market and carbon
label schemes.
