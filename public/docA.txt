Figure 1-16: Energy Efficiency Situation in 2020
Energy Efficiency Situation: In 2020, energy intensity significantly improved, with a
decrease of 7.53% from 2010. A decline resulted from the Government’s energy-efficiency
policy, particularly Thailand’s National Energy Efficiency Plan of 2018–2037 targeting
Energy Intensity (EI) reduction in 2037 by 30% from the base year of 2010. The Energy
Efficiency Plan provides financial assistance and incentives for energy projects related to
energy conservation, renewable energy, research and development, public awareness
promotion, and training on energy efficiency.

Development 2021, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
The main achievements of energy development targeting indicators for SDG 7—Ensure
access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, focused on three
areas:
• Access to energy: Thailand has made significant progress in access to electricity
from 82.1% in 2000 to 99.21% in 2020. This is due to the efforts to promote local energy
generation in far-off areas and increase the generation efficiency throughout the energy
chain.
• Uptake in renewable energies: Thailand aims to increase the percentage of
renewable energy in final gross consumption to 24.08% by 2030. In 2020, renewable
energy constituted 15.99% of final gross consumption, an increase from 10.9% in 2011.
• Improve energy efficiency: Thailand’s Government aims to reduce Energy
Intensity (EI) by 30% by 2036 compared to levels from 2010. In 2019, EI stood at 7.85%,
which was an 8.08% decrease and equaled the saving of 7,541 ktoe.
