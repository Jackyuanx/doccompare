3. MITIGATION ASSESSMENT
3.1

Introduction

Efforts continued to be taken by Malaysia to mainstream mitigation actions into its
development through the development and implementation of polices, plans and
programmes that have mitigation co-benefits which at the same time meets the
development needs of the country. Specifically in the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025),
one of the main thrusts is on ‘Advancing Green Growth to Enhance Environmental
Sustainability’. There are three priority areas for this thrust and each priority area has
respective strategies which are as follows:
i.

ii.

iii.

Priority Area A – Implementing a Low-Carbon, Clean and Resilient
Development
• Strategy A1 – Moving Towards a Low-Carbon Nation
• Strategy A2 – Accelerating Transition to the Circular Economy
• Strategy A3 – Sharing Responsibility in Pollution Prevention
• Strategy A4 – Increasing Resilience against Climate Change and
Disasters
Priority Area B – Managing Natural Resources Efficiently to Safeguard Natural
Capital
• Strategy B1 – Conserving Natural Ecosystems
• Strategy B2 – Protecting and Conserving Species and Genetic
Resources
• Strategy B3 – Ensuring Sustainable Utilisation and Benefit Sharing
• Strategy B4 – Enhancing Conservation of Water Resources
Priority Area C – Strengthening the Enabling Environment for Effective
Governance
• Strategy C1 – Strengthening Environmental Governance
• Strategy C2 – Scaling-up Green Financing and Investments
• Strategy C3 – Instilling Sense of Ownership and Shared Responsibility

The emphasis to minimize GHG emissions are highlighted through the green growth
implementation, energy efficiency enhancement and green mobility promotion
initiatives in the 12th Malaysian Plan as well. The awareness of the need to accurately
quantify mitigation actions and their effects is also increasing among the government
agencies and the private sector.
Additional efforts however are required for Malaysia to meet the mitigation targets
stated in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021. That pledge
expressed Malaysia’s commitment to reduce by 45% its GHG emissions per GDP by
2030, relative to its emissions intensity in 2005.
This chapter provides a summary of polices, plans and programmes in place to drive
the mitigation agenda of the country as part of its sustainable development agenda.

An indicative GHG emissions modelling projection on possible mitigation pathways for
Malaysia to fulfil its Paris Agreement target is also provided. The quantified Mitigation
Actions and Their Effects are reported in the Fourth Biennial Update Report.
3.2 National Policy and Framework
A brief description of the updated national Policy and Planning Framework for
mitigation is provided as below.
3.2.1 National Policy on Climate Change
The main policy to guide Government agencies, industry, communities and other
stakeholders in addressing the challenges of climate change in an effective and
holistic manner is provided in the National Policy on Climate Change approved by the
Cabinet in 2009. The policy recognised the need for both mitigation and adaptation to
be carried out in a balanced manner where national responses that consolidate
economic, social and environmental development goals are mainstreamed based on
the following five principles:
•
•
•
•
•

Development on a sustainable path: To integrate climate change responses into
national development plans to fulfil the country’s aspiration for sustainable
development;
Conservation of environment and natural resources: To strengthen implementation
of climate change actions that contribute to environmental conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources;
Coordinated implementation: To incorporate climate change considerations into
the implementation of development programmes at all levels;
Effective participation: To improve participation of stakeholders and major groups
for effective implementation of climate change responses; and
Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities:
International involvement on climate change will be based on the principle of
common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

3.2.2 Sectoral Policies
The policies that give effect to mitigation are contained in sectoral polices related to
the energy; transport; IPPU; waste; land use, land-use change and forestry; and
agriculture sectors. These policies are implemented by the respective Ministries and
their associated Agencies through the Malaysia Development Plans.
Table 3.1 summarises the major mitigation actions across those sectors and their
related key policies. The practical targets of these mitigations are discussed in greater
detail in the respective sections of the GHG emission projection section of this chapter.

3.2.2.1 Energy Management and Conservation
In 2019 the power sector contributed 32% of the country’s GHG emissions. Energy
security and affordable electricity rates to consumers remain the main priorities of the
country. Hence to a large extent, the energy mix for electricity generation is dictated
by population affordability. Nevertheless, efforts are being taken to cap the share of
coal in the energy mix. In addition, efforts continue to be taken to enhance the share
of clean and green energy sources in its electricity generation and at the same time
encouraging energy efficiency in its usage.
The National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) was recently launched in July 2023
with aims to power the future by unlocking potentials in new growth areas and
delivering progress and prosperity to Malaysian households and businesses. The plan
aspires to steer Malaysia’s shift from traditional fossil fuels-based economy to a highvalue green economy. The policies conducted and outlined in this plan will be reported
in the first Biennial Transparency Report of Malaysia in 2024.
Apart from NETR, the Hydrogen Economy and Technology Roadmap (HETR) was
also recently launched in October 2023 with the aims to achieve decarbonisation and
to spearhead the hydrogen economy through the application of hydrogen and its
derivatives. It is a living document for new industrial development propelled by the
applicable technologies and innovations.
Renewable Energy
In the 12th Malaysia Plan, the development and utilisation of renewable energy will be
intensified from 21.5% in 2019 to 31% by the end of the plan in 2025. The focus in the
renewables include greater usage of biomass and biogas, apart from implementation
of power generation from hydro and solar resources. The contribution of mitigation
actions through the RE electricity from solar is estimated to increase through the
increased installed capacity of renewable power sources. The adoption of new
technologies comprising the energy storage system is planned to be promoted to
address the intermittency issue in the renewable energy.
Energy Efficiency
A number of energy efficiency programmes had been reported since the first BUR.
The newest of these is the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan which has been
approved in 2016 for implementation. The NEEAP sets a target to save 52,233 GWh
58

 
amount of electricity over a 10-year period from 2016 to 2025 that corresponds to an
electricity demand growth reduction at the end of the plan of about 8.0%. These would
be implemented through five initiatives namely,
Initiative 1: Promotion of 5-Star Rated Appliances;
Initiative 2: Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS);
Initiative 3: Energy Audits and Energy Management in Buildings and Industries;
Initiative 4: Promotion of Co-generation; and
Initiative 5: Energy Efficient Building Design.
Through the implementation of NEEAP initiatives, GHG emissions are expected to be
reduced.
3.2.2.2 Transport
The transport sector has been remained the second largest GHG emitting sector in
the country based on the historical trend, accounting for 20% of the country’s total
GHG emissions in 2019. Of these 20%, about 17% comes from road transportation.
The National Transport Policy (NTP) 2019-2030 has been developed to lay the policy
thrusts and strategies to enhance Malaysia’s economic competitiveness, provide
strong social impact particularly with respect to inclusivity and accessibility, while
reducing the negative impact of the transport system on the environment. It provides
an overarching policy to guide relevant federal ministries and agencies as well as State
Governments and Local Authorities (PBT) to develop and streamline transport
initiatives towards a common goal, resulting in effective and efficient use of resources.
Among the initiatives is to mainstream the shift towards electrification in the
transportation industry as a key strategy to diminish our emissions and contribute
towards the achievement of our national Paris Agreement GHG target. In the urban
areas, especially in the Greater Kuala Lumpur Area, urban rail development had been
implemented since the mid 1990’s.
Continued implementation of the National Biofuel Policy has also resulted in higher
blends of biodiesel being implemented for the transport sector. The B10 programme
has been implemented since the year of 2019. While B20 biodiesel programme
implementation is targeted to start in 2020 with phased nationwide rollout subject to
infrastructure readiness, the B30 biodiesel blending target is to be implemented by
2030 especially for the heavy vehicles.
In the new National Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) described below, the
electric vehicle development is one of the four focusses in the master plan. It is also
one of the four new growth areas identified in the NIMP 2030. There are plannings to
install up to 10,000 charging stations to support the electric vehicle implementation in
Malaysia. To achieve the target, the electric vehicle ecosystem and the supply chain
will need to be strengthened.

59

 
3.2.2.3 Industrial Processes and Product Use
Prior to 2020, the development of industries in Malaysia was guided by the Third
Industrial Master Plan 2006-2020. That policy guided Malaysia’s long-term global
competitiveness and innovation of the manufacturing and non-Government services
sectors during that period. It covered 12 industries namely electrical and electronics,
medical devices, textile and apparel, machinery and equipment, metals, transport
equipment, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, wood-based, rubber based, oil-palm
based and food processing. Success of the plan however had attracted investments
in some high energy intensive and high GHG emitting sectors towards the end period
of the plan.
NIMP 2030 was launched in September 2023. This policy aims to drive the next phase
of the country’s industrial development and advance its economic complexity,
particularly in five key sectors: aerospace, digital economy, chemicals and
petrochemicals, electrical and electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Among its missions
is to push towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial
sector through:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

accelerating transition towards sustainable practices in the industrial sector;
enhancing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy;
catalysing low carbon technologies and carbon capture as new growth areas;
advancing circular economy and industrial waste management; and
shifting towards green infrastructure.

The plan would help to quicken early peaking of greenhouse gas emissions from the
industrial sector and there after guide its greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards
net zero as early as 2050.
The NIMP 2030 is a planning follow up to the New Investment Policy which was
launched in October 2022. The New Investment Policy takes a comprehensive
approach to catalyse high-quality investments to deliver forward-looking and equitable
growth for the nation. One of the top line targets is sustained economic and wealth
growth at 4.5-5.0% GDP growth per annum and GNI per capita growth at 5.5-6.0%
per annum. It aspires to enhance environmental, social and corporate governance
practices and de-risk the economy against these factors.
3.2.2.4 Waste Management
As stated in Chapter 2, without LULUCF, the waste sector contributed about 9% of the
country’s GHG emissions. The GHG emissions from this sector come mainly from
methane emissions from solid waste disposal sites and from Palm Oil Mill Effluents
(POME). The National Solid Waste Management Policy 2016 and the 12th Malaysia
Plan (2021-2025) set a target of 40% recycling rate by 2025. The 12 th Malaysia Plan
also envisages that all seven types of waste (solid, sewage, scheduled waste,
agriculture, construction and radioactive) shall be managed in a holistic manner based
on a life-cycle approach, with increase investment to channel waste away from waste
disposal sites to be used as a resource, either as input for other products or converted
to energy. Such processes would help to reduce waste generation and contribute to
GHG emissions reduction.
60

 
Reducing methane emissions from POME continues to be encouraged through
Developing Biogas Facilities at Palm Oil Mills. Through this programme, palm oil mills
are encouraged to install biogas trapping facilities to capture methane as fuel for their
use or to generate electricity for sale to the national grid. In 2014 the Government
mandated new palm oil mills and old mills that are expanding their capacity to install
methane avoidance facilities. However, uptake has been slower than anticipated with
only 130 facilities being installed by 2020.
3.2.2.5 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
The LULUCF sector plays an important role in Malaysia’s action to address climate
change. This sector remains a net sink while contributing to the nation’s GDP. Hence
it is necessary to continue to strengthen the sustainable forest management efforts of
the country and enhance the forest reserves.
The management of all types of forests is enshrined in the Malaysia Policy on Forestry
(MPF) or other relevant State Forests Policy. This policy provides greater uniformity in
implementing strategies for achieving forest conservation, management, and social
and educational needs. It represents an important policy framework, which is
unequivocal in maintaining that forest management must fulfil environmental and
conservational needs besides meeting rational economic production goals. It provides
a reference, guidelines and strong emphasis on the necessity for sound management,
conservation, utilisation, development and protection of the forests for the three
regions namely Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak. This commitment is duly recognised
and given specific attention by the National Forestry Act 1984 (Amendment 2022)
(NFA). In Sabah, the necessary legal backing is provided by the Sabah Forest
Enactment 1968, Forest Rules 1969 and Forest (Timber) Enactment 2015 while in
Sarawak the Sarawak’ Forests Ordinance 2015 (Cap.71), provides the necessary
legal framework.
To ensure sustainable forest management, a National Committee on Sustainable
Forest Management in Malaysia comprising representatives from various agencies in
the forestry sector was formed in 1994 to ensure that the International Tropical Timber
Organisation’s (ITTO) Criteria and Indicators on sustainable forest management are
fully implemented. The standard used to asses Forest Management Units (FMUs) for
the purpose of certification is the MC&I Standard of Performance for Forest
Management [MC&I (2001)] which is based on the 1998 ITTO Criteria and Indicator
for Sustainable Management of Natural Tropical Forest. The key elements for
sustainable forest management would cover economic, social, environmental and
conservational aspects.
To ensure sustainable harvesting of timber, a forest certification scheme was started
from 2002 with the adoption of the Malaysian Criteria and Indicators (MC&I) for
Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) certification. The maximum cutting limit has
been capped at 85 m3/ha. The Malaysian Timber Certification Council was established
in October 1998 as an independent organisation to develop and operate the Malaysian
Timber Certification Scheme (MTCS). The MTCS provides for independent
assessment of forest management practices, to ensure the sustainable management
of Malaysia’s natural forest as well as to meet the demand for certified timber products.
For 2020, a total of 5,139,745.36 ha of natural forests and 132,989.48 ha of forest
61

 
plantations have been certified under the MTCS Programme for the Endorsement of
Forest Certification (PEFC) Scheme.
Under the 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), efforts were taken on forest enrichment to
improve degraded forests. Programmes such as the Central Forest Spine in
Peninsular Malaysia and the Heart of Borneo programme in Sabah and Sarawak serve
as enablers to enhance connectivity between forests, reduce fragmentation and at the
same time improve natural resource management. This is continued in the 12 th
Malaysia Plan, (2021-2025) where the government has committed to ‘Advancing
Green Growth for Sustainability and Resilience’. In the main ’Game Changers’,
reducing dependency on natural resources and maintaining at least 50% forest cover
has been listed as one of its targets.
A REDD plus Strategy has been developed and adopted in 2017. The Strategy
outlines policy actions to ensure at least 50% of Malaysia’s land mass remains as
forest. This is achieved through enhancing sustainable forest management,
conservation activities and seeking synergies with activities under the National Policy
on Biological Diversity 2016-2025.

3.2.2.6 Agriculture
The development of the agriculture sector in Malaysia is guided by the National
Agrofood Policy 2021—2030 (NAP2.0) and the National Agricommodity Policy (20212030), which respectively aim to increase food production and exports of industrial
commodities. The objectives of the National Agrofood Policy are to ensure food
security and that the food produced is safe to eat; to make the agro-food industry
competitive and sustainable; and to increase the agro-based entrepreneur’s level of
income.
Without LULUCF, agriculture accounts for 3% of Malaysia’s GHG emissions in 2019.
Synthetic fertiliser usage accounts for about 31.6% of these emissions and efforts are
being made to optimise fertiliser application.
Two certification schemes guide sustainable agriculture implementation in Malaysia.
The Malaysian Good Agricultural Practices (MyGAP) launched in 2013 is a
comprehensive certification scheme for the agricultural, aquaculture and livestock
sectors. The Malaysian Organic Scheme (currently known as MyOrganic) launched in
62

 
2007 is a certification programme to recognise organically cultivated farms which do
not use chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers.
For the commodity crops, increase of exports is to be met by increase in yield per
hectare. Oil palm is the largest of these commodity crops and both the upstream and
downstream activities of this sector are being improved to address land use
competition. As of 2019, about 5.90 million ha were planted with oil palm in Malaysia
and the maximum arable land for this crop is estimated at 6.5 million ha in 2020. The
anticipated increase in global demand for vegetable oil will be met through increased
oil yield per hectare. The National Agricommodity Policy and Action Plan 2021-2030
targeted an increase of average oil yield of 3.47 tonnes per hectare in 2019 to 3.70
tonnes per hectare by 2025 and 4.0 tonnes per hectare by 2030. The average fresh
fruit bunch (FFB) yield is targeted to increase from 17.19 tonnes per hectare in 2019
to 18.25 tonnes per hectare by 2025 and 19.5 tonnes per hectare per year by 2030.
Environmental performance regulations and sustainability criteria are complied with
through the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO), Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) and other sustainability certification schemes. Currently, all big oil
palm plantations are MSPO or RSPO certified to ensure environmental sustainability.
The National Agricommodity Policy 2021-2030 targeted all oil palm plantations to be
MSPO certified by 2030.
3.2.3 Malaysia Development Plans
The ambition of the sectoral polices described in sections are operationalised through
the five-year Malaysia Development Plans. Due to competing needs of the different
areas, implementation is dependent on the availability of development funds which is
tied to the economic growth during the period.
It is useful to note that the 11th Malaysia Plan provides the supports to address climate
change through the emphasizing of sustainability. The 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025)
described in the introduction takes these efforts further by having the strategic priority
areas and the supporting initiatives. The fundamental shift is towards a development
model that views resilient, low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially inclusive
development as an investment that will yield future gains. The 12th Malaysia Plan
(2021-2025) had set advancing sustainability as one of its three themes. Driving
decarbonisation of the energy sector through greater deployment of renewable energy
is one of the focusses.
3.3

GHG Emission Projection

This section presents an assessment on Malaysia’s GHG emission projection. The
assessment had been carried out for the period from 2020 until 2030 for the five
sectors namely Energy, IPPU, Waste, Agriculture and LULUCF. Three key scenarios
have been explored in the assessment. In the Without Measures (WOM) scenario, the
GHG emissions are projected based on a “no additional policy intervention” criterion.
The With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario takes into account the existing policies
and planned initiatives in 2019 that would be implemented until 2030. The With
Additional Measures (WAM) scenario looks at potential emissions reduction when
additional mitigation measures are implemented.
63

 
3.3.1 GHG Emission Projection Assumptions
The assumptions applied include the applicable sectoral and population growths are
based on the pre-COVID-19 condition. The projection for the WOM scenario used
population information as the Table 3.3 and GDP growth is based on the assumptions
as the Table 3.4.
Key Note:
The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the end of 2019 and relatively ended in
2022 is estimated to cause a decrease of energy demand due to domestic lockdown
which contributes to a lower value of energy supply. During the preparation works
of NC4, actual energy data for the year of 2020 was still in the process of publication
by the related agency. Hence, the projection for the year of 2020 and onwards is
based on the pre-COVID-19 condition assumptions.
The updates pertaining to the actual energy data for 2020 and 2021 as well a
relatively updated projection will be reported in the next reporting document e.g. the
First Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1).

The macroeconomics projections up to 2030 are then used to generate energy
demand functions using the regression software Microfit2. The energy demand
functions generated then is used to estimate the final energy demand and supply
projections and GHG emissions for the energy sector.
3.3.2 Summary of GHG Emission Projection Results
The projection indicates that the total emissions without LULUCF for Malaysia would
be 481,363 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM case by 2030 (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.5).
Continued implementation of the planned activities under the WEM scenario would
bring the emissions down to 367,603 Gg CO2 eq. If further mitigation activities under
the WAM scenario are carried out, the GHG emissions could reduce to 337,554 Gg
CO2 eq. The mitigation assumptions for each of the scenarios and sectors are
described in section 3.3.3.

Figure 3.1: Projected Greenhouse Gas Emission Time Series for WOM, WEM
and WAM Scenarios

The energy sector is projected to continue to be the largest contributor of GHG
emissions in 2030 followed by the IPPU and waste sectors. For the WEM scenario
without LULUCF, the GHG emissions from the energy sector is likely to be 80% of the
total emissions in 2030. This is followed by the IPPU sector at around 11%, the waste
sector at about 6% and the agriculture sector at 3%. For the WAM scenario without
LULUCF, the energy sector is likely to account for 78% of the emissions in 2030. This
is followed by the IPPU sector at 13%, the waste sector at 7% and the agriculture
sector at 3%.
2 Microfit is an econometric software to generate the demand equations for each of the fuels and

sectors.

3.3.3 GHG Emission Projection Assessment for Each Sector
3.3.3.1 Energy Sector
Table 3.6 summarizes the assumptions for the energy sector mitigation actions for the
three aforementioned mitigation scenarios, WOM, WEM and WAM. Some of the
mitigation actions listed in the table for the WEM and WAM scenarios are lower in
target compared to the policy aspirations in Table 3.1 due to financial and technical
limitations in implementing those targets. These more realistic targets adopted for the

In all the three mitigation scenarios, the energy demand is projected to continue to
grow in tandem with the increasing population and GDP. The modelling results
indicate that energy demand will grow from 68.9 Mtoe3 in 2020 to 90.7 Mtoe in 2030
in the WOM scenario and from 68.5 Mtoe in 2020 to 90.5 Mtoe by 2030 for the WEM
scenario. For WAM scenario, the energy demand in 2020 and 2030 will be 68.0 Mtoe
and 89.8 Mtoe respectively (Figure 3.2). The results indicate that more aggressive
energy efficiency programmes across the sectors need to be put in place to reduce
the demand.

In tandem with the growth in energy demand, the GHG emissions for the energy sector
for WOM scenario will also to grow over the projected time period (Figure 3.4).
However, the GHG emission for the WEM and WAM scenarios will be relatively lower
than WOM due to the effects of the aforementioned mitigation measures in the WEM
and WAM scenarios.

Figure 3.4: Projected GHG Emissions for the Energy Sector for WOM, WEM
and WAM Scenarios

The WOM scenario is projected to have the highest GHG emission growth rate from
among the three scenarios, with an annual growth rate of 2.5% from 2020 to 2030.
Under the WEM scenario, where existing mitigation policies are implemented, the
emissions are expected to be reduced by 6.4% (17,506 Gg CO2 eq) by 2020 and up
to 22.7% (79,242 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030, relative to the WOM scenario. Further emission
reductions are anticipated in the WAM scenario i.e. by 6.4% (18,043 Gg CO2 eq) from
the WOM scenario by 2020 and 28.7% (100,035 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030.
Analysis of the projected GHG emissions for each of the energy sub-sectors (Table
3.6) indicates that GHG emissions from the electricity sector would continue to be the
largest emitter. However, the magnitude of GHG emission is estimated to be reduced
in both WEM and WAM scenarios. In the WEM scenario, the GHG emissions will
decrease from 101,206 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 98,657 Gg CO2 eq in 2030. For the WAM
scenario, GHG emissions is estimated at 100,622 CO2 eq and 91,442 CO2 eq in 2020
and 2030 each. These results indicate that increase of RE capacity in power
generation and energy efficiency initiatives are necessary to help reduce emissions
from this sub-sector.
The largest increase in GHG emissions in the energy sector comes from the
manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector, increasing from 35,416 Gg CO2
71

 
eq in 2020 to 55,580 CO2eq in 2030 for the WEM scenario. In 2020 and 2030, the
value of estimated GHG emissions is 35,391 and 55,544 CO2 eq respectively under
the WAM scenario. These increases will require further effort to reduce the GHG
emissions of the manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector through certain
initiatives and policies while supporting the competitiveness of the industry.
The second largest increase in projected GHG emissions is from the transportation
sub-sector, increasing from 63,382 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 66,334 Gg CO2eq in 2030
for WEM scenario and from 62,104 Gg CO2 eq to 64,473 Gg CO2 eq in 2030 under
WAM scenario.
In the projections, the GHG emissions from the natural gas transformation GHG for
WOM scenario are assumed to remain around the range of the 2019 values for the
projection period. The GHG emissions reduction projected for the WEM and WAM
scenarios are based on the mitigation actions mentioned in Table 3.6. For the fugitive
emissions from the oil and gas industry, the mitigation actions for reduction are shown
in Table 3.7.

3.3.3.2 Industrial Processes and Product Use Sector
From the GHG Inventory, within this sector in 2019, the metal industry contributed the
highest share (39.8%) of the sector’s GHG emissions, followed by mineral industry
(30.7%), the chemical industry (17.5%) and the electronics industry (8.5%). GHG
emissions from industrial processes however were projected to increase in these subsectors over the next decade due to expansion of production capacity, especially in
the iron and steel industry. Emissions from the iron and steel industry would depend
on control on the number and capacity of iron and steel mills approved for production.
Except for the cement and iron and steel industries, differences in the GHG emissions
between WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios for the other sub-sectors in this
assessment were basically based on production growth rates.
Production of cement in Malaysia increased from 16.66 million tonnes in 2005 to 20.04
million tonnes in 2019. The cement production is projected to grow at about 2.5% per
year until 2030, based on the existing capacity of 48.959 million tonnes per annum
and with an operating capacity of 41%. Cement production in Malaysia is highly
concentrated, with the top five players having a total market share of 90%.
Reduction of emissions from energy usage has been taken into account in the energy
sector calculations, hence this section shall only concentrate on the option of
decreasing the share of clinker in cement production by adding additives like fly ash.
In the first Biennial Update Report (BUR1), it has been recommended that the cement
industry in Malaysia could reduce its clinker ratio to 0.75:1 by the year 2030 to help
reduce emissions from cement production. Based on this, the proposed clinker content
per tonne of cement in the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios are as shown in Table
3.8.

Table 3.8: Summary of Proposed Mitigation Scenarios for Cement Production
Mitigation Action
Reduce clinker ratio

WOM Scenario
The clinker ratio to
cement is at 88%
(0.82:1) level until
2030.

WEM Scenario
Cement producers
to reduce the
clinker ratio from
88% in 2019 to
81% in 2030.

WAM Scenario
Clinker ratio to be
reduced from 88%
in 2019 to 78% in
2030.

Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the projected GHG emission growths in
all the three scenarios for the IPPU sector is as shown in Figure 3.5 and Table 3.9.
Here the GHG emissions for each of the sub-sector is estimated for the projection
period based on each sub-sector’s projected production and using the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines. The GHG emission is projected to grow from 32,853 Gg CO2 eq in 2019 to
82,462 Gg CO2 eq, 56,585 Gg CO2 eq and 50,662 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM, WEM and
WAM scenarios respectively in 2030.

3.3.3.3 Agriculture
As mentioned earlier food security is one of the key concerns of Malaysia. In 2019
emissions from the agriculture sector was about 9,922 Gg CO2 eq., with direct N2O
emissions from managed soils accounting for about 3,737 Gg CO2 eq. (37.7%) of the
emissions and rice cultivations accounting for about 2,269 Gg CO2 eq. (22.9%) of the
emissions. Increasing self-sufficiency in food production especially livestock would
lead to increase level of GHG emissions.
Reducing emissions from the agriculture sector through good agriculture practices
would include optimising the usage of synthetic fertiliser for crop yield. This can be
achieved by applying what is commonly known as the 4R’s:
•
•
•
•

Right N application rate
Right formulation (fertiliser type)
Right timing of application, and
Right placement

Discussions with the agriculture research institutions indicate the possibility of
reduction of about 10% of synthetic fertiliser application through the 4R strategy for oil
palm cultivation, the largest crop under cultivation in Malaysia. The assumption for
reducing synthetic fertiliser application for the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios for the
agriculture sector is as shown in Table 3.10.
Table 3.10: Summary of Proposed Mitigation Scenarios for Oil Palm Cultivation

The application

105 kg N per year
per hectare for
mature oil palm.

The application
rate of fertiliser
usage:
90 kg N per year
per hectare for
young oil palm and
105 kg N per year
per hectare for
mature oil palm.

Assume that the
application rate of
nitrogenous fertilisers
reduces by 10% from
2020 onwards
through optimum
application of
synthetic fertiliser.

Efforts are also being taken to limit the areas under oil palm cultivation. While the
WOM scenario would likely see oil palm cultivation reaching 7 million hectares, efforts
are being taken by the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities to restrict oil palm
cultivation to a maximum land usage of 6.5 million hectares by 2030 which was used
for the WEM and WAM modelling scenarios.
For rice cultivations, increasing productivity per hectare of paddy planted area
especially in the irrigated granaries, would reduce the need of additional land for rice
77

 
cultivation. The National Agrofood Policy 2.0 2021-2030 (NAP 2.0) and Action Plan
targeted a productivity of 7 tonnes of paddy yield per hectare especially in the
granaries by 2030. This scenario was used for the WAM case, while the WEM used a
mid-value productivity yield value of 5.7 tonnes of paddy per planted by 2030 and the
WOM scenario used the 2005-2019 average productivity yield of 4.576 tonnes per
hectare of granary planted area.
Livestock population emissions were modelled based on the full achievement of NAP
2.0 meat and dairy self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) targets for the WOM case and the 66%
achievement of NAP 2.0 SSR targets for the WEM case based on historical trends
and from reverse investment initiatives. While the achievement of the 33% SSR
objective for the WAM is because of food imports contributing to a decrease in GHG
emissions.
Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the projected GHG emissions for the three
scenarios for the agriculture sector is as shown in Figure 3.6 and Table 3.11. The
projections indicated that the GHG emissions for the agriculture sector would grow
from 9.922 Gg CO2 eq. in 2019 to 16,256 Gg CO2 eq., 13,615 Gg CO2 eq. and 11,309
Gg CO2 eq. under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios in 2030.

3.3.3.4 Waste
GHG emissions from the waste sector arise from two major sources, i.e., solid waste
disposal and wastewater treatment and discharge (domestic and industrial), where
most of the emissions are in the form of methane. Out of the 28,257 Gg CO 2 eq. of
GHG emissions from this sector in 2019, industrial waste water treatment and
discharge contributed 51% (14,462 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions with nearly 99% of
this part of the emission coming from POME. Solid waste disposal sites contributed
41% (11,681 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions and domestic waste water contributed 7%
(2,065 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions.
Logically the mitigation efforts in this sector should be focused on reducing methane
emissions from solid waste disposal sites and from POME. Table 3.12 is a summary
of the mitigation actions assumed for the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios in the
projection. The assumptions for recycling follow closely the targets set in the policies.
For methane recovery from POME, although the earlier policies proposed the
implementation of biogas capture facilities for 500 palm oil mills by 2020, the uptake
by that industry has been slower than expected where in 2019 only 125 out of 452
palm oil mills have been fully equipped with biogas capture facilities. Based on
discussions with the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities and the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board (MPOB) it is projected that the yearly increment of mills with biogas capture
would be five per year. It is evident that greater push for implementation of biogas
capture facilities in palm oil mills is needed.

Figure 3.7 and Table 3.13 show the projected GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030 for
the WOM, WEM and WAM mitigation scenarios. The results indicate that GHG
emissions from the waste sector would grow from 28,257 Gg CO2 eq in 2019 to 34,094
Gg CO2 eq. and 28,095 CO2 eq. under the WOM and WEM scenarios respectively in
2030. However, under the WAM scenario the GHG emissions from the waste sector
could reduce to 27,067 Gg CO2 eq. in 2030. This could be achieved by diverting
organic wastes away from landfills for treatment and greater implementation ambition
on establishing biogas capture facilities at palm oil mills as well as better flaring
efficiency and usage of the methane captured in these facilities for energy generation.

3.3.3.5 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
Of the five categories of land use under the IPCC categories, forest and crop land are
the most important categories. These two categories account for more than 75% of
the total land use of Malaysia. Some of the wetlands like peatland is reported in both
forest and cropland. Mitigation potential for grassland and wetlands are relatively small
while assessment for settlements is being undertaken.
Net Forest Change
Malaysia’s deforestation rates stabilised, between 2009 to 2015 there was no net
forest loss. However, the increasing population (estimated to reach 38 million by 2030)
together with increased demand for food, transportation and other infrastructures puts
pressure on forest.
Projected forest loss between 2020 and 2030 was derived from historic rate of forest
conversion. Figure 3.8 shows the projected forest cover until 2030. Forest loss of
65,000 ha per year is expected under the WOM scenario between 2020 and 2030
while in the WEM and WAM scenarios, 50,000 ha and 47,000 ha respectively were
projected to be lost annually over the same period.
Based on these scenarios, Malaysia would still maintain 52.7%, 53.1% and 53.2% of
its total land area as forest under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively in
2030 (Table 3.14).

Sustainable Forest Management
With the implementation of sustainable forest management and forest certification, the
maximum harvest is limited to 85m3/ha and follows all the principles, criteria and
indicators set in Malaysia Criteria and Indicator (MC&I). The historical rate of decrease
in wood harvest is about 4% per annum from 2005 to 2019. The current scenarios do
not include potential enhancement of carbon stocks in degraded forest especially
when forest corridors are established. It only considered the increment in carbon
stocks, drained organic soils and commercial harvest.
For the mitigation assessment, a conservative assumption was made for the projected
commercial wood harvest. For all the three scenarios wood harvest are projected to
increase from 2020 to 2025 and then reduce from then onwards to 2030 (Table 3.15).
By 2030, with the decreasing harvest rate from 2025 onwards, the projected
commercial harvest is around 16.051 million m3 per year, 14.891 million m3 per year
and 13.726 million m3 per year for WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively.

Cropland
The expansion of cropland area is limited in Malaysia due to limited arable land
targeted for agriculture. Labour shortage has also resulted in abandoned farms
especially for rubber and rice cultivation. The current trend in oil palm expansion
comes primarily from abandoned cropland and this trend may continue. The projected
growth in the cropland is focused on enhancing productivity of the smallholders
engaged in commodity tree crops like oil palm and rubber. The expansion of tree crops
under the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios are shown in Table 3.16.

Projected LULUCF Emissions and Removals
For the forest category, enhancing sustainable forest management (SFM) and
conservation would reduce emission. The implementation of CFS and HoB have
potential to increase forest connectivity and enhance removals. It is anticipated that
future supply of wood from the plantation forest would increase and lesser harvesting
would occur from natural forest. Deforestation would occur in the State Land Forest.
Biomass loss of 140t d.m./ha, 127t d.m./ha and 144t d.m./ha for forest, oil palm and
rubber respectively were applied in the calculation of GHG emissions. For
deforestation, it is assumed that all of the above ground biomass is removed.
For Cropland, marginal increase in removals is anticipated while conversion of
cropland to settlement would also be stabilised. It is anticipated that 7,600 ha of rubber
plantation and 2,000 ha of oil palm will be converted to settlement on annual basis
respectively.
The total emission and removals from forest and crop land is shown in Table 3.17
under the three scenarios.

Plan for Improvement

As mitigation actions through different policies and programmes are being
implemented across the different Ministries and Agencies, a coherent and robust
Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System is necessary for keeping
track of the integrated impacts of these implementations in reducing the GHG
emissions in the country. A step-wise approach has been taken in developing this
system in Malaysia with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental
Sustainability as the Secretariat to the Technical Working Group of Mitigation and
Technical Working Group on Transparency and Related Activities.
In moving strategic directions in implementing the policies that will give effect to GHG
emission reduction, one of the critical information that is sought by policymakers is
accurate information on projection of future GHG emissions. The current efforts in
modelling the projected emissions are the efforts in providing such information for
informed decisions making on strategic directions for implementing mitigation actions.
More accurate modelling is required, in particular those coupled with accurate
information on abatement costs. Moving towards more sophisticated models would
be attempted.
