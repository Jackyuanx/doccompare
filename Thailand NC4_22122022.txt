FOREWORD
The international collaboration, with public recognition and awareness of climate change,
has significantly increased since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, which is
in accordance with the IPCC comprehensive assessment reports on climate change. In
particular, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) revealed the wide-spread and severe
climate impacts in the near term, escalating risk from higher temperatures causing
irreversible climate change impacts, and increased vulnerability to climate risks due
to inequality and development challenges, all of which indicate that the world needs
urgent mitigation and adaptation actions to address loss and damages. Thus,
a monumental step was made at COP26 when all member states came together with
the ambitious decision to put their best efforts into limiting the average temperature
increase to less than 1.5°C. To achieve this goal, global net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions must be pursued by 2050.
Thailand recognizes the severe impacts of climate change and the significance of holding
the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to
limit the increase to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement. At COP26 World Leaders
Summit, Thailand announced the country’s new ambitious targets to reach carbon
neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and 2065, respectively,
and increase NDC contributions up to 40% upon timely and adequate international
support on finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. In terms of actions,
Thailand has mainstreamed climate change agenda into its national plans: the 20-Year
National Strategy, National Economic and Social Development Plans, Climate Change
Master Plan, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action
(NAMA), and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Furthermore, the Long-Term
Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) and the 2nd updated
NDC were revised and submitted to UNFCCC by COP27. The revisions focus on the
alignment of mitigation measures and 2050 carbon neutrality and 2065 net-zero GHG
emissions, just transition, and optimization of socio-economic impacts. In the 2nd
updated NDC, Thailand elevated the contribution level to 40%, with 30% from our
domestic effort and 10% from international support. This target is challenging for the
energy, transport, and agriculture sectors. The challenge also includes raising awareness
and participation from all relevant sectors, particularly the private sector, which urgently
needs to adapt and enhance its capacity for business competition to keep pace with
the rapidly changing global circumstances and trends.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

Thailand’s Fourth National Communication (NC4) has been prepared in accordance with
UNFCCC guideline. The NC4 is a medium for Thailand to communicate its commitment
to fulfilling the obligations under Article 4.1 and 12.1 of the UNFCCC. It presents
updated and more comprehensive information on the national circumstances;
institutional arrangements; national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory; mitigation
policies, plans, and measures; achievement of GHG emissions reduction under NAMA;
preparation for the implementation of NDC; vulnerability and adaptation; other
information and activities relevant to climate actions; and constraints, gaps, support
needed, and support received to implement its adaptation and mitigation actions. The
chapter on vulnerability and adaptation also serves as Thailand’s first adaptation
communication.
On behalf of the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning
(ONEP), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), I would like to
express my sincere gratitude to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the funding and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a coordinating and implementing
agency, for its technical support. My appreciation also extends to representatives of
Ministries, sub-national government agencies, academic institutions, private sectors,
civil societies, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies for their
contributions in the preparation of this report.
Thailand will continue to put the utmost effort into prioritizing and implementing our
policies to combat climate change and limit the increase of global average temperature
under the Paris Agreement according to the country’s vision toward net-zero GHG
emissions by the second half of this century.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Thailand, as a Non-Annex I Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), is obligated to submit National Communications (NCs)
every 4 years and Biennial Update Reports (BURs) every 2 years. Thailand submitted its
first, second, and third NC on 13 November 2000, 24 March 2011, and 29 August 2018,
respectively. This report, the fourth NC (NC4), has demonstrated the country’s intention
to actively implement climate actions and share the results with UNFCCC and the global
community. According to Conference of the Parties (COP) guidelines, the NC4 consists
of 6 chapters as follows:

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
The physical context reveals the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts as
above-average temperatures tend to rise, precipitation has fluctuated over time,
population structure is becoming an “aging society,” and its long coastal zone faces
coastal erosion and sea-level rise. Thailand relies largely on commercial energy
production and consumption, but renewable energy shares have continued to increase.
The country’s natural resources exhibit not only the abundance and absorptive capacity
but also the degrading conditions from climate-induced disasters.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic contraction during 2019-2020.
In particular, the tourism sector, which had always been a significant part of Thailand’s
economic growth generating approximately 20-22% of GDP, suffered a drastic decline.
This resulted in an increase in plastic and infectious wastes and a slight increase in the
poverty line and inequality indicators. On the positive side, the COVID-19 controlling
measures led to a reduction in energy consumption and production, improvement in
overall air quality due to less traffic circulation in the transport sector and economic
activities, a general decline of all other diseases, reinforcement of Thailand's healthcare
system for coping with newly emerged diseases, and recovery of natural resources in
touristic sites.
As a final point, National Committee on Climate Change Policy (NCCC) serves as a
national institute overseeing climate policy development and implementation. It was
initially composed of 5 Subcommittees, but 2 Subcommittees have been recently
instituted to advance Thailand’s climate actions—the Subcommittee on the Mobilization
of GHG Mitigation with Carbon Sequestration in LULUCF Sector and the Subcommittee
on the Mobilization of GHG Mitigation with CCUS Technology Implication.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY
The inventory report was prepared using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories and presented Thailand’s national GHG emissions from
2000 to 2018 by sources and removals by sinks. The GHG emissions estimated in this
report include both direct and indirect emissions: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4),
Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6), Nitrogen
Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds
(NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2). The GHG emission is calculated by the Thailand
Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory System (TGEIS).
In 2018, total GHG emissions (excluding those from LULUCF) were 372,648.77
GgCO2eq. Net GHG emissions were 286,680.47 GgCO2eq (including those from
LULUCF) resulted from the Energy sector (257,340.89 GgCO2eq), Agriculture sector
(58,486.02 GgCO2eq), IPPU sector (40,118.18 GgCO2eq), and Waste sector (16,703.68
GgCO2eq). The Energy sector remained the most significant contributor to Thailand’s
GHG emissions, accounting for 69.06% of the total GHG emissions. The share of
emissions from the Agriculture, IPPU, and Waste sectors were 15.69%, 10.77%, and
4.48%, respectively. LULUCF contributed to a net removal of -85,968.30 GgCO2eq.

Figure: Total GHG emissions by sector (excluding LULUCF) 2018

MITIGATION MEASURES
Thailand has made efforts to uphold its commitment under the Convention by
integrating climate change mitigation into its national and sectoral policies and plans
and implementing mitigating measures in order to achieve the national GHG reduction
targets—NAMA’s target to reduce GHG emissions by 7-20% from BAU by 2020 and
NDC’s target to reduce GHG emission by 20-25% from BAU by 2030. Thailand submitted
the 2nd updated NDC, which aligns with an ambitious pledge to reduce GHG emissions
by 30% from the BAU level by 2030. The contribution level increases to 40%, subject
to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial
resources, and capacity-building support. Furthermore, Thailand will continue efforts to
meet the long-term goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero GHG emissions
by 2065.
Thailand implemented NAMA’s mitigation measures and successfully achieved a GHG
reduction of 56.54 MtCO2eq in 2020 from 10 mitigation measures in the energy and
transport sectors which is 15.40% lower than its BAU level. As NAMA ended in 2020,
Thailand has transitioned toward NDC, which aims to reduce GHG emissions in the
energy, transport, industrial process and product use, and waste management sectors.
In addition, Thailand has also increasingly developed supporting measures and
voluntary actions to mitigate GHG reduction, such as the carbon market and carbon
label schemes.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION
Thailand, a developing country, is ranked 9th as the most affected country by climate
change impacts in the last 20 years (2000-2019) by Global Climate Risk Index 2021
(CRI), both in terms of human impacts (fatalities) and direct economic losses. Thailand,
by ONEP and RU-CORE, has developed a database of geospatial risks from climate
change by assessing climate impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities in 6 significant sectors:
water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural
resources management, and human settlement and security. The risk and vulnerability
assessments for climate projection are based on the top-down approach using climate
scenarios generated through the most updated version of General Circulation Models
(GCMs) and RCP models, which are derived from data in the SEACLID/CORDEX SEA
Phase II project. For all the 6 sectors, 3 types of climate hazards—heat, drought, and
flooding—are considered together with socio-economic factors. The vulnerability
assessments show that climate impacts are not homogenous across hazard, type, time,
and areas. Different sectors and different regions in Thailand are vulnerable to different
climate hazards. In addition to the physical impacts of climate change, Thailand is also
vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions, particularly the aging population.

OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION AND ACTIVITIES
Chapter 5 depicts other information and activities of climate actions that complement
and empower the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures enabling
Thailand to achieve the objectives of the Convention. The information and activities
include technology development and transfer; research and systematic observation;
education, training, public awareness, public participation, and public access to climate
information; capacity building; and information sharing and networking. First, Thailand
has established a mechanism for technology transfer and formulated a climate
technology database and roadmap indicating technologies that require further
development aligning with key sectors stated in Thailand's NDC and Thailand's NAP.
Significant technologies have been developed to reach carbon neutrality and net-zero
targets in the energy sector, such as technologies related to electric vehicles and
hydrogen fuel. Second, research and systematic observation have been conducted
in climate variable sectors: atmospheric, terrestrial (i.e., land and water), and oceanic
domains. Third, Thailand has engaged in implementing capacity-building initiatives
as well as Actions for Climate Empowerment (ACE) under Article 6 of the UNFCCC,
which involves not only climate knowledge dissemination but also the environmental
rights of the public to participate and access climate information. Finally, ONEP acts
as a primary entity for climate information sharing, and Thailand cooperates with
international communities at bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels to address
climate change issues.

CONSTRAINTS, GAPS, NEEDS, AND SUPPORT RECEIVED
Thailand has received support from various international partners to facilitate
climate actions in mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment, including
the preparation of Thailand's Fourth National Communication (NC4) and Third Biennial
Update Report (BUR3) to the UNFCCC. From 2020-2022, Thailand has received support
from multilateral and bilateral partners for a total of 34 projects, entailing 18 mitigation
projects with a total amount of 31,438,771 USD, 10 adaptation projects with a total
amount of 48,667,056 USD, and 6 enabling environment projects with a total amount
of 3,419,548 USD. Most support was a combination of technical support and capacity
building.
However, considering remaining constraints and gaps, Thailand still needs international
support in terms of finance, technical expertise, technology transfer, and capacity
building to ensure the achievement of LT-LEDS in a short-term period (2025-2035), a
mid-term period (2040-2050), and a long-term period (2050-2065). More support is
needed, particularly for technology development and transfer, which is essential for
mitigation and adaptation implementation. For mitigation, Thailand needs support
for the energy transition toward renewable sources focusing on renewable energy
technologies (such as solar and wind), enhancing the potential use of Carbon Capture
Storage (CCS) & Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies, and
developing other technologies to achieve GHG emission reduction and a net-zero
emission. For adaptation, support is needed for developing a data map showing areas at
risk of climate change impacts and accessible viable adaptive technology. To enhance
the enabling environment, Thailand requires support for developing and strengthening
mechanisms, instruments, and policy implementation, such as financial instruments
and incentives to engage private sectors in green investment and capacity building for
all stakeholders to integrate climate actions into their respective practice and plans.

CHAPTER 1:

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

Thailand, a developing country, is ranked 9th as the most affected country by climate
change impacts in the last 20 years (2000-2019) by Global Climate Risk Index 2021 (CRI).
Its long coastal zone of 24 provinces with a total area of 101,678 km2, a total coastal
length of 3,151 km, and an approximately 20 million population are among the most
vulnerable to climate risks, particularly coastal erosion. The devastating climate change
crisis leads to substantial social and economic loss as coastal communities and economic
activities, mainly fishery and tourism, are inevitably affected. Bangkok and its perimeter
provinces adjoined to the coast and rivers are ranked as one of the top cities in the world at
the highest risk of severe flooding resulting from precipitation change, sea-level rise, and
coastal erosion under climate change.
Setting the stage, this chapter lays out Thailand’s national circumstances in all climaterelated domains displaying the social, environmental, and economic conditions and how
they are intertwined with climate change. In addition, the link between the reported
information and Thailand’s implementation for achieving sustainable development is
highlighted as sustainable development goals, and climate change actions are
complementary and greatly aligned.
The physical context section reveals the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts, whereas
the energy section shows the extent to which Thailand relies on fossil fuels as
the primary energy source. The natural resources section exhibits not only the abundance
and absorptive capacity of natural resources but also the degrading conditions that
occurred from economic activities and climate-induced disasters. The state of environment
section seeks to report environmental quality and management in three sectors: air
quality, water quality, and waste management. The section on national economic and social
development sets out the national development objectives, priorities, and outlook as
well as the key economic and social sectors vastly affected by and interlinked with climate
change—agriculture, tourism, health, poverty and inequality, and gender equality.
As a final point, the chapter illustrates Thailand’s establishment of inter-ministerial
committees to oversee climate policy development and implementation and
comprehensive national systems to monitor, evaluate, and report on progress. Two
more subcommittees on carbon sequestration and CCUS have been instituted in
the institutional arrangement to advance Thailand’s climate actions.

1.1 Physical Context
1.1.1 Geography
The Kingdom of Thailand is situated in the tropical zone of the Southeast Asia region
between latitudes 5° 37’ N and 20° 27’ N and longitudes 97° 22’ E and 105° 37’ E,
encompassing a total area of 513,115 km2. Thailand has territorial borders with
Myanmar and Laos in the North, Laos and Cambodia in the East, Malaysia in the South,
and Myanmar in the West. The significant topography of Thailand is a peninsula with
a total coastal length of 3,151.02 km, consisting of the Andaman Sea coast of 1,111.04
km in the west and the Gulf of Thailand coast of 2,039.97 km in the east.

1.1.2 Administrative Area
Region: Thailand comprises the Northern high mountains, the Central plains, the Northeast
plateau, and the Southern coastal plain. It was officially geographically divided into the
six-regions system in 1977, and this continues to be the most well-known and commonly
used division for local administration. The six official regions are 1) North, 2) West,
3) East, 4) Northeast, 5) South, and 6) Central.

Figure 1-2: Thailand’s six regions division

CHAPTER 1
Province: Thailand is divided into 76 provinces, excluding the capital, Bangkok. Thailand’s
public administration is divided into 3 tiers: central, provincial, and local administration.
The central administration comprises the ministries, departments, and bureaus. The
positions at the field units are from each central department responsible for
implementing government policies. The provincial government consists of provinces,
and each province is divided into districts. The local administration consists of Provincial
Administrative Organization, Municipality, and Sub-district Administrative Organization.
There are also 2 special local governments under the local administration: Bangkok and
Pattaya. While Pattaya is part of Chonburi Province (and therefore also subject to the
provincial organization), Bangkok operates at the provincial level. Unlike the other 76
provinces, Bangkok is a particular administrative area, locally governed by the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration (BMA).

1.1.3 Population
1.1.3.1 Population Density
Population density: According to registration records, the total population of Thailand
in 2021 was 66,171,439, making it the 20th most populated country in the world. Over
the past decade, the average annual population growth rate has been around 0.4%.

Figure 1-3: Population and Annual Growth Rate 1995-2021
Remark: In 2004, The Department of Provincial Administration reviewed and made necessary corrections to remedy
double counting issues in Thailand’s total population figures. Accordingly, this chart reflects the accurate, corrected figure
of the country’s total population.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
1.1.3.2 Population Projections
Population projections: The population’s projection remains relatively the same as
reported in the BUR3. It is projected to increase gradually and start to decline after 2030.
Thailand’s population structure is becoming an “aging society” as it faces a decline in
birth rate but an increase in life expectancy. By 2040, the aging population will be more
than double that of the youthful population. This demographic transition translates
into two challenges: 1) the development of a mechanism to support aging members of
society, and 2) the development of national policies and plans to promote social and
health services for mothers and newborns.
Considering this challenge, Thailand has developed the 5-year Quality Births project
(2017-2021) and maternal mortality rate reduction plans for local areas and provinces.
Research on the causes of maternal mortalities is conducted on a continuous basis.
Furthermore, Thailand has advanced the implementation of the 2nd National
Reproductive Health Development Polcy Strategy (2017-2026), with provisions on
pregnancy testing and antenatal care, birth costs, financial aid for newborn babies,
maternity leave and compensation, provision of tax reductions for costs related to
the care of babies, tax reductions for childcare facilities. These implementations also
serve as progress relating to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3)—Ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

1.1.4 Climate
1.1.4.1 Seasons and Temperature
Thailand’s climate is influenced by two main seasonal monsoon winds: the southwest
monsoon and the northeast monsoon. The southwest monsoon starts in May and
brings a stream of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean toward Thailand, causing
abundant rain over the country, especially on the windward side of the mountains.
The northeast monsoon starts in October and brings cold, dry air from the anticyclone in
the Chinese mainland over major parts of Thailand, mainly focused on the north and
northeast regions. The climate of Thailand can be broadly divided into 3 seasons:
1) Rainy, or the southwest monsoon season, from mid-May to mid-October 2) Winter or
the northeast monsoon season, from mid-October to mid-February and 3) Summer, or
the pre-monsoon season, from mid-February to mid-May.
Data on temperature fluctuations in Thailand over the ten-year period of 2012-2021
showed the highest temperature period. These high temperatures are likely to continue
to rise. In April 2016, Thailand recorded its highest temperature since 1951 at 44.6°C in
Mae Hong Son province. Between 1981-1990, mean temperatures increased by 0.33°C,
while 1991-2000 and 2001-2010 recorded temperature increases of 0.16°C and 0.14°C
per decade, respectively. The average temperature in Thailand from 2011 to 2021

Energy Efficiency Situation: In 2020, energy intensity significantly improved, with a
decrease of 7.53% from 2010. A decline resulted from the Government’s energy-efficiency
policy, particularly Thailand’s National Energy Efficiency Plan of 2018–2037 targeting
Energy Intensity (EI) reduction in 2037 by 30% from the base year of 2010. The Energy
Efficiency Plan provides financial assistance and incentives for energy projects related to
energy conservation, renewable energy, research and development, public awareness
promotion, and training on energy efficiency.

The main achievements of energy development targeting indicators for SDG 7—Ensure
access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, focused on three
areas:
• Access to energy: Thailand has made significant progress in access to electricity
from 82.1% in 2000 to 99.21% in 2020. This is due to the efforts to promote local energy
generation in far-off areas and increase the generation efficiency throughout the energy
chain.
• Uptake in renewable energies: Thailand aims to increase the percentage of
renewable energy in final gross consumption to 24.08% by 2030. In 2020, renewable
energy constituted 15.99% of final gross consumption, an increase from 10.9% in 2011.
• Improve energy efficiency: Thailand’s Government aims to reduce Energy
Intensity (EI) by 30% by 2036 compared to levels from 2010. In 2019, EI stood at 7.85%,
which was an 8.08% decrease and equaled the saving of 7,541 ktoe.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

The forest area deteriorates from deforestation and forest fire, which occur from
extreme heat and drought as part of the climate change impacts and agricultural
burning. Striving to tackle the problems and achieve SDG goal 15—Protect, restore,
and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests,
combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss,
Thailand has taken the following steps:
• Legal instruments: Thailand enacted laws, regulations, and measures to
manage and maintain the richness of the forest and its ecosystem. Key legal instruments
include the Forest Act (1941), National Reserved Forest Act (1964), Wild Animal
Reservation and Protection Act (1992), Commercial Forest Plantation Act (1992), Chain
Saws Act (2002), National Park Act (2019), and the Community Forest Act (2019).
• Strategic plan: The 5th strategy of the 20-Year National Strategy (2018-2037)—
environmentally growth for sustainable development—aims to prevent deforestation
and increase forest areas to 55% by 2037. The 20-Year Strategic Plan for the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment (2017-2036) further elaborates in the first strategy
that the goal is to protect and conserve forest areas for sustainable development of
natural resources and biodiversity, including monitoring and preventing forest fires.
• Forest conservation: In 2020, Thailand expanded forest conservation from
105,696 km2 in 2006 to 116,304 km2. This is equivalent to 23% of the total land area,
including 22 national parks extending across 6,416 km2.

Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning

1.3.2 Water Resources
Thailand has 22 major river basins and 353 sub-basins. There are 27 groundwater sources,
contributing around 1,130 billion m3. Of this amount, only roughly 45 billion m3 per year
has the potential to be extracted for utilization. In 2020, the natural surface flow was about
199 billion m3, a 31.4% increase from the previous year. In 2021, the total demand for
water activities was about 100 billion m3. The most significant demand was for agriculture,
representing 82.50%, followed by the demand for ecosystem conservation, consumption,
and industry at 12.81%, 3.73%, and 0.98%, respectively.
Thailand has experienced problems with water resources, such as water shortage, drought,
floods, decreased groundwater levels, and saltwater intrusion in groundwater sources.
Severe droughts in 1979, 1994, and 1999 affected almost every part of the country.
There have been an increasing number of recurring droughts over the last 10 years,
which have affected a total area of around 42,280 km2. Over the past 30 years, Thailand
has experienced flooding in almost all provinces, causing damage to life, property, and
the economy. In 2011, Thailand faced severe flooding, which impacted over 13 million
people, with economic damage costing more than 1.44 trillion THB.

17

CHAPTER 1
Therefore, aiming to manage the country’s water resources effectively and align with SDG
6—Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Thailand
has set the 20-Year National Strategy (2018-2037) and formulated the 20-Year Master Plan
on Water Resources Management (2018-2037) with 6 key focus areas: management of
water use, security of water production, inundation control, water quality conservation,
afforestation in watershed areas and soil protection, and managing approach. Thailand
has made overall achievements as follows:
• Access to clean water: Thai people have been able to sufficiently access drinking
water, with the proportion of household members able to access clean drinking water
rising from 97% in 2012 to 98% by 2016 and 99.5% in 2019. Government efforts to
provide clean water for villages without existing plumbing systems have been successful,
with the number of such villages reduced from 7,321 to 169.
• Water quantity: In 2019, the Royal Irrigation Department increased water storage
capacity by 16.7 million m2 and increased the amount of irrigated land by 188,296 rai.
The Department of Water Resources and the Department of Groundwater Resources
excavated an additional 2,228 pools and developed a plan to renovate 3,400 km of
water pipes in order to reduce the amount of water lost in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and
Samutprakan. A target was set to reduce the amount of water lost from 25% to 20%.
• Water quality: In 2019, the Ministry of Interior, as the responsible agency for
developing the water consumption system, installed water systems in 1,197 villages across
the country and expanded water systems in all provinces and the Bangkok Metropolis to
over 26,000 additional households.
• Ecosystem: The Government has advanced the protection and revival of
ecosystems linked to water sources. During 2018-2019, Thailand implemented
measures to revive 110,921 rai of upwater forest areas, which represents 15% of the
target set in the Water Management Masterplan.

1.3.3 Marine Resources
Thailand has 24 coastal provinces, with a total area of 101,678 km2 and a coastal length
of 3,151.02 km. The total maritime territory is 321,247 km2, consisting of Internal Waters
61,023 km2, Territorial Sea 52,216 km2, Contiguous Zone 37,185 km2, Exclusive Economic
Zone 163,644 km2, and Thai-Malaysia Joint Development Area 7,179 km2.

18

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Marine and coastal resources entail 2,779 km2 of mangroves, 256 km2 of seagrass,
238 km2 of coral reefs, 971 islands, and 609 beaches. The coastal area and marine resources
have been adversely affected by climate change impacts and the expanding economic
activities, causing many critical problems such as coastal erosion, coral bleaching,
acidification of seawater, degradation of coral reefs and seagrass, depletion of marine
animals, and increased marine plastic litter.
Thailand has acknowledged the degradation of marine environmental resources
and the severe impacts of climate change; thus, it seeks to address the problems and
implement SDG 14—Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine
resources for sustainable development. Thailand has accomplished the following:
• Legal ground: The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) is
the key government agency in enforcing management and conservation measures
under the Marine and Coastal Resource Management Promotion Act 2015. The Act
is a policy-based legal tool that sets out the principles and methodologies for
responsible government agencies to manage coastal and marine resources efficiently
and effectively. It also stresses the significance of public participation in the management
process.
• Implementations: From 2017 to 2020, key initiatives and implementations for
resources conservation and restoration include research on coral bleaching and
acidification of seawater, planting coral and seagrass, establishing a marine
life rescue center for rare species, and enforcing preventive measures for Illegal,
Unreported, and Unregulated fishing (IUU). Spatial ecosystem management has been
promoted by growing and restoring over 263,008 m2 of coral reefs and 96,000 m2 of
seagrass and installing 4,710 artificial reefs in 8 sites across 7 provinces.
• Protected areas: Thailand has designated 35 marine protected areas extending
across 15,336 km2, or 4.74% of the country’s total maritime zone. Six other areas
totaling 11,865.29 km2, or 3.67% of the total maritime zone, are currently being
reviewed. By 2030, Thailand aims to declare 10% of its total maritime zone as marine
protected areas according to the National Reform Plan.
• Marine plastic pollution: Thailand set out its policies and measures to reduce
single-use plastic production and consumption, particularly to address plastic pollution
in coastal and marine areas. Aligning with Waste Management Master Plan (2016-2022)
and Plastic Waste Management Road Map (2018-2030), DMCR has implemented many
projects and activities with the Marine and Coastal Resources Research & Development
Institute to reduce plastic marine litter. The activities include researching the effects of
marine plastic litter on the marine environment and animals, collecting marine plastic
litter data, analyzing microplastics in the marine environment with Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), organizing International Coastal Cleanup (ICC), collecting
plastic litters using SCG-DMCR Litter Trap and the Ocean Cleanup Interception BV
(on-going importation process). As a result, as of 2020, Thailand eliminated 199 tons of
marine plastic litter.

19

CHAPTER 1

• Technology: The government advanced the application of satellite remote
sensing for marine pollution and ships investigations using satellite images from
TERRA/AQUA, which allows for seawater quality monitoring, the development of
a seawater quality database through the SNAPP and NOAA-20 satellites, and the
development of PyGNOME, a system to provide area-specific water direction and
speed forecasts.

1.3.4 Biodiversity
Thailand is one of the most biodiverse countries in Southeast Asia. According to
the ONEP’s report on Thailand’s biodiversity status in 2020, national biodiversity can be
classified into four groups:
1. Ecosystems: 7 types of Thailand’s ecosystems are forest, mountain, agriculture,
marine and coastal, island, inland water, and dry and semi-humid.
2. Plant species: From the publication of Flora of Thailand in 2015, Thailand
hosted around 12,050 plant species. Later, various national and international botany
journals on plant taxonomy published from 2014 to 2020 revealed 239 new plant
species in Thailand.
3. Animal species: There are more than classifiable 6,928 invertebrate species and
5,005 vertebrate species in 2021, an increase of 274 species from 2015. Of all
the vertebrate species, 676 are listed as threatened species, with 141 critically
endangered, 191 endangered, and 344 vulnerable.
4. Microorganism species: There are over 200,000 species that are diverse in terms
of species, genetic, and ecological contexts.

Biodiversity condition in Thailand is threatened by the increased socio-economic
activities and climate change impacts which may cause severe biodiversity loss and
degraded ecosystems. ONEP, as a national focal point of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), has initiated many implementations to fulfill the commitments under
the CBD, such as developing the World Biodiversity Framework 2020, organizing
activities for the International Day for Biological Diversity 2020, formulating the
Fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook: GBO5, and organizing the Summit on Biodiversity
and other related meetings.
For domestic operations, ONEP has worked as a secretary in the National Biodiversity
Conservation and Exploitation Committee, responsible for proposing guidelines, policies,
measures, and plans for the conservation and exploitation of the country’s biodiversity
to the Cabinet, including providing policy recommendations for integrating and linking

20

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

strategic operations under the plan to achieve goals and maneuvering the Integrated
Biodiversity Management Master Plan 2015-2021. The Master Plan adopted the Strategic
Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 as a framework for the operation’s direction, focusing
on conservation, restoration, protection, and exploitation of biodiversity and ecosystem
services. The implementation of the Master Plan is in line with the Sustainable Development
Goals 2, 6, 14, and 15, which focus on 1) maintaining, protecting, and restoring biodiversity,
2) stopping biodiversity threats, 3) promoting access and benefit-sharing of genetic
resources and local wisdom in an equitable and justifiable manner, and 4) promoting
the sustainable management and exploitation of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In
addition, ONEP has drafted the Biodiversity Bill, a harmonized law for unifying
biodiversity management that promotes and supports the conservation and sustainable
exploitation of biodiversity. The Bill aims to eliminate the disparities of legal enforcement
on biodiversity issues and serves as an effective mechanism for integrating biodiversity
into policies of relevant sectors.
According to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, maintaining biodiversity
richness by supporting sustainable use within regenerating capacity of its components
is the key mission to ensure the equilibrium between economic development and
environmental protection, as indicated in SDG 15—Protect, restore and promote
sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat
desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
Thailand’s overall achievements include:
• Financial support: the Government has increased environmental budgets every
year. In 2021, the budget increased from 2019 by 88.32% (from 8.572 billion THB
in 2019 to 16.143 billion THB in 2021). An additional 13.267 billion THB has been
allocated to conserve biodiversity from 2017 to 2022.
• Conservation: Thailand has designated wetlands of importance to natural
ecosystems, registered under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance. Thailand also designated biosphere reserves (limited to terrestrial
ecosystem) extending across 2,672 km2 in 2020.
• Operation center: The Government has preserved and promoted a healthy
forest ecosystem by establishing Forest Protecting Operation Centers. The Centers
provide an integrated platform and serve as the headquarters for anti-deforestation
operations, the reclamation of forest areas from illegal ownership, the management of
national parks in accordance with IUCN Green List Standards, and efforts to promote
patrolling standards reform in reserved forest areas.
• Biodiversity loss prevention: Natural habitat loss, including forest and coastal
ecosystems, has decreased. In 2019, forest areas in the country extended over 163,984
km2, or 31.68% of the country’s total land area. This amount increased slightly from
2017. In 2018, the mangrove area extended 4,576 km2, increasing by 86.37% from
2014. Overall, grass resource areas remain at the same level and are in better health.
Coral reefs now extend across 238.44 km2, increasing by 0.05% from 2015. Compared

21

to 2015, the growth rate for coral reefs looks set to continue at the same rate. From
2017-2018, the wetlands area extended to 5,792.3296 km2, increasing from 20152016 by 5.06%.

1.4 State of the Environment
1.4.1 Air Quality
Six major air pollutants in Thailand are Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2), Nitrogen Dioxide
(NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and
particulate matters (i.e., particulate matter <10 microns: PM10, and <2.5 microns: PM2.5).
Overall air quality in 2020 was relatively improved compared to the previous year. In
particular, the yearly average amount of PM2.5 was 23 micrograms per cubic meter
(μg/m3), 8% decreased from 2019, and PM10 was 43 μg/m3, 9% decreased from 2019.
The highest 8-hour average amount of ozone was 81 μg/m3, 11% decreased from 2019.
Critical areas Bangkok and its vicinity: The PM2.5 problem in 2020 was around 20-25
μg/m3 (decreased from 2019). The decreased pollution was due to the implementation
of the Action Plan for Driving National Agenda “Addressing Pollution Problem
(Particulate Matter)” of Pollution Control Department under the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment and the COVID-19 pandemic causing less industrial
production capacities, travel activities, and energy consumption.
Haze in Northern provinces: The situation was slightly more violent than in 2019.
There were 112 days in which particulate matter exceeded the standard. The accumulated
number of hotspots was 88,855 (a 2% decrease from 2019). The highest 24-hour average
amount of PM2.5 was 366 μg/m3 (a 4% increase from 2019). The primary cause was a
large number of agricultural burnings in combination with dry weather, which caused
the rapid spread of forest fires. Measures addressing the Northern haze problem were
implemented under the mechanism of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act 2007
by determining 4 areas (forest, agricultural, roadside, and community areas) and 5
measures (command system, fuel reduction, awareness raising, network/volunteer
building, and law enforcement). These included the upgrade of 12 measures following
the Ad-hoc Action Plan in Addressing Pollution Problem (Particulate Matter), the use
of aircraft for supporting forest fire mitigation missions, the determination of a strict
burning ban period, and the setting up of the Forest Fire Mitigation Center.
Na Phra Lan Subdistrict, Saraburi Province: There were 92 days in which PM10
exceeded the standard (39% decreased from 2019). The yearly average amount of PM10
was 107 μg/m3 (9% decreased from 2019). In collaboration with the Committee on
Prevention and Mitigation of Particulate Matter Problem in the Pollution Control Area,

22

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

various action plans and public participation are implemented, such as monitoring of
PM10 both in ambient air and from pollution release from sources, spot checking of
vehicles which did not follow the law, and road cleaning to reduce the amount of
dispersed particulate matter.
The area of Map Ta Phut, Rayong Province: Benzene and 1,3-butadiene increased,
while 1,2-dichloroethane decreased from the previous year. The objectives of measures
addressing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are as follows: 1) to find causes and
control the leakage, 2) to prepare the industrial plants and related organizations
to implement new regulations on the standard for controlling exhaust ventilation from
petroleum refineries to control benzene ventilation in terms of surveillance around the
fence, and 3) to monitor the situation by various committees in Rayong Province.

1.4.2 Water Quality
Surface water: The water quality of 59 water sources and 6 still water resources: 2% was
of excellent quality (equal to 2019), 37% was of good quality (9% increased from 2019),
43% was of fair quality (7% decreased from 2019), and 18% was of poor quality (equal to
2019). There were 8 from 59 water sources found to be the same quality as their types
of use. In the past 10-year period (2011-2020), the quality of water sources tended to be
better, and most of them were of fair to good quality and none was of very poor quality.

CHAPTER 1
Coastal water: The coastal water quality: 4% was of excellent quality (100% increased
from 2019), 60% was of good quality (2% increased from 2019), 27% was of fair quality
(21% decreased from 2019), 7% was of poor quality (133% increased from 2019), and
2% was of very poor quality (equal to 2019). The overall coastal water quality was
improved. The changing trend of coastal water quality in the past 10-year period was
mostly good, except in the Gulf of Thailand with continuing poor quality.

Figure 1-20: State of coastal water quality 2009-2020
Source: Thailand State of Pollution Report 2020, Pollution Control Department

Groundwater: According to the monitoring system of groundwater quality and
groundwater level from 2,716 observation wells, and 1,724 stations scattered in 27
groundwater basins, the groundwater was generally of good quality under the
groundwater standards for consumption according to the Groundwater Act 1977. Some
areas had high iron and manganese, resulting from geological and hydrogeological
conditions. In 2020, some sites of shallow groundwater layers were contaminated with
heavy metals and volatile organic compounds from landfills and waste disposal sites of
industries and some industrial estates.
The major causes of deteriorated surface water and coastal water quality were the
discharge of effluents from the municipal sector, households, tourist places, industrial
sector, and agricultural sector. The municipal wastewater treatment systems were
insufficient, and some were still ineffective. Wastewater management in the industrial
and agricultural sectors was still ineffective. There were still obstacles to implementation,
such as the complexity of wastewater treatment technology, the lack of competent
personnel in wastewater management, and the use of large areas in applying uncomplicated
wastewater treatment technology because most productions still depend on community
ways and seasons.

1.4.3 Waste Management
Solid waste: In 2020, the amount of solid waste was 25.37 million tons (12% decrease
from 2019). The municipal solid waste was sorted at the sources and recycled as 8.36
million tons (33% decrease from 2019), properly disposed of as 9.13 million tons (7%
decrease from 2019), and improperly disposed of as 7.88 million tons (24% increase from
2019). The top five clean cities in 2020 were Bangkok, Phuket, Lamphun, Rayong, and
Nonthaburi, respectively. In 2020, the amount of municipal solid waste in Bangkok and
its vicinity and some Local Administration Organizations was reduced, partly due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, the “Work from Home” measure led to the increased
amount of Single-Use plastic, especially in urban areas, due to product and food purchase
services via an online system. The amount of plastic waste generated during the pandemic
was approximately 6,300 tons per day, which was a 15% increase from the normal period
of approximately 5,500 tons per day. Since 1 January 2020, Thailand has implemented
“Everyday Say No to Plastic Bags” policy with the announcement of measures banning
plastic bags provided in department stores, supermarkets, and convenience stores.

CHAPTER 1
Household hazardous waste: In 2020, household hazardous waste was approximately
658,651 tons (a 1.6% increase from 2019). Most of them were wastes from electrical and
electronic equipment, with 428,113 tons (65%). Other types of hazardous waste were
batteries, dry cell batteries, chemical containers, and aerosol spray cans with 230,538
tons (35%). From the government policies supporting the household hazardous waste
management system, Local Administration Organizations and related organizations had
to provide the collection points of household hazardous waste in the community and
their collection centers at provincial levels. As a result, the household hazardous waste
were properly managed at 121,695 tons (18.48% of generated household hazardous
waste), which increased from the previous year but still represented an insignificant
proportion. The mismanagement of household hazardous waste was caused by the lack
of awareness, non-separation of hazardous waste from general wastes, no regulations
to enforce household hazardous waste management, and no law to oversee the
management of waste from electric and electronic equipment. However, the guideline
for household hazardous waste management aimed to increase the Drop Points of
household hazardous waste at community and provincial levels, enhance cooperation
networks among the public, private, and people sectors on household hazardous waste
management, and encourage the launching of the Wastes from Electric and Electronic
Equipment Management Bill.

Infectious waste: In 2020, the amount of infectious waste was 47,962 tons (a 10%
decrease from 2019). However, in 2021, the amount of infectious waste increased to
90,009 tons (87% increase from 2020) caused by hospitals under the Ministry of Public
Health, hospitals under the Department of Academic Affairs of the Ministry of Public
Health, sub-district health promotion hospitals, hospitals affiliated with other ministries,
private hospitals, private clinics, animal hospitals, dangerous infection laboratories
and other sources of COVID-19 infected wastes such as field hospitals, state quarantine
facilities, community isolation. Most of the infected wastes, approximately 81,773 tons
or 90.85%, were properly disposed. The Pollution Control Department has published
the preliminary guideline on managing used masks to prevent the epidemic for the
local authorities and the public. In addition, a survey on the number of used masks
was conducted by coordinating with the local authorities to report the number of used
masks via QR Code monthly. Between 1 April and 31 December 2020, 17.89 tons of
used masks were managed by disposing in landfills (25.01%), burning in the
incinerators of local authorities (9.40%) and local authorities nearby (5.60%), eliminating
by a private company who must get rid of infectious waste (8.52%). Others (51.47%)
were collected and sent to the sub-district health promotion hospitals and the hospitals
in the area or the Sub-district Administrative Organization to dispose by soaking in
disinfectant and burning or sent to the public health in the area to dispose properly.

1.5.2 Profile and Outlook
Economic Profile and Outlook
Thailand has a mixed economic system, consisting of resource-based, service-based, and
industrial-based economic activities. In 2021, the Thai economy grew by 1.6%, recovering
from a decline of 6.2% in 2020. GDP value at current prices was 16.2 trillion THB (505.6
billion USD). GDP per capita was 232,176 THB per person per annum (7,255.5 USD). For
economic stability, the headline inflation was at 1.2%, and the current account registered
a deficit of 2.2% of GDP. On the production side, agriculture, manufacturing, and
wholesale and retail trade sectors grew by 1.4%, 4.9%, and 1.7%, respectively. On the
other hand, the accommodation and food services sector and transport and storage
services sector declined by 14.4% and 2.9%, respectively. On the expenditure side, the
export of goods, private consumption, and investments expanded by 18.8%, 0.3%, and
3.4%, respectively. Export value was recorded at 70.5 billion USD, significantly increasing
by 21.3%. The export volume and price indices expanded by 16.8% and 3.8%, respectively.

27

CHAPTER 1

The Thai economy in 2022 is projected to expand in the range of 3.5–4.5%, mainly
supported by: (i) the regaining in domestic demand; (ii) the recovery of domestic
tourism; (iii) the continual expansion of the export of goods; and (iv) the support from
public investment. The export value of goods in US dollar terms is anticipated to
expand by 4.9%. Meanwhile, private consumption expenditure and private investment
are expected to increase by 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Public investment is projected
to increase by 4.6%. Headline inflation is estimated to be in the range of 1.5 – 2.5% and
the current account is projected to record a surplus of 1.5% of GDP

Social Profile and Outlook
National Economic and Social Development Council analyzed five key social indicators
for assessing Thailand’s social situation and movement—employment, household debt,
health and illness, the safety of life and property, and consumer protection. The 2021
report reveals that measures to control the spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact
on the labor market. As a result, the number of unemployed persons and the unemployment
rate reached their highest levels in the third quarter of 2021 but began to recover in the
fourth quarter of 2021. Prime issues to be followed include the implementation of
economic measures supporting an economic recovery while containing the outbreak,
the significant increase of the informal workforce, the increased cost of living, and
the promotion of skill development and modification in response to enterprise and local
needs.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
1.5.3 Agricultural Sector
In 2021, total agricultural production increased by 1.4%, recovering from a decline of
3.5% in 2020. The production increased by 0.7% in the fourth quarter, slowing down
from 2.2% growth in the previous quarter, following declines in livestock, fisheries, and
paddy production.
The agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts causing
temperature rise and rainfall fluctuation. The Office of Agricultural Economics estimates
national economic loss due to severe climate impacts in the agricultural sector to be up
to 1.8 billion THB. From 2011 to 2045, climate change impacts can cause cumulative
damage up to 17,912–83,826 million THB per year. Thus, Thailand aims to strengthen
sustainable farming and agricultural management, employing both mitigation and
adaptation measures to increase resilience, minimize economic-environment loss, and
secure sufficient food production for the increased population growth and quality of life.
These goals are aligned with SDG 2—End hunger, achieve food security and improved
nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Thailand’s primary achievements include:
• Food poverty reduction: Thailand has reduced the number of people living in
food poverty. This is in line with Thailand’s improved standing in the World Food
Security Index and the overall reduction in the number of people per capita who have
been unable to access sufficient food in the last 3-5 years. Moreover, Thais have enjoyed
greater access to food. In 2019, the number of those under the food poverty line was
0.37%, a reduction from 0.54% in 2016. Furthermore, Thailand’s ranking in the Global
Food Security Index (GFSI) has improved, with an average score of 65.1 out of 100 in
2019, compared to 58.3 in 2017 and 58.9 in 2018.
• Increasing agricultural productivity: Thailand has experienced good progress
in increasing the value of productivity per labor unit and the gross income of smallscale agricultural producers. In 2019, the gross agricultural product was valued at 673
billion THB, compared to 609 billion THB in 2016. Employment in the agricultural
sector increased from 12.57 million in 2016 to 12.69 million in 2019.
• Increasing sustainable agriculture: Thailand has increased the amount
of sustainable agricultural land in the past 3-4 years, with increased investment in
the sector from the Government. This aims to support mixed agriculture, New
Theory Agriculture, organic farming, and natural farming. This enabled Thailand to
increase the amount of land used in sustainable farming from 1.08 million rai in 2017
to 1.15 million rai in 2020.

CHAPTER 1
1.5.4 Tourism Sector
Tourism has always been a significant part of Thailand’s economic growth, generating
approximately 20-22% of GDP. In 2019, though affected by global economic stagnation,
the number of tourist visitors slightly expanded by 1.36% (307,141,990 persons). The
annual revenue from the tourism sector increased by 1.10% (2,727,903.84 million THB)
from the previous year. The expansion was partly supported by the Government’s continual
measures to promote the tourism sector, especially an extension of waiving visa-on-arrival
fees for citizens of 21 nations.
However, the sector suffered a drastic decline in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
a nationwide lock-down measure, resulting in decreased tourists by 54.72% (139,067,291
persons) and annual revenue by 69.85% (822,578.62 million THB). Thailand imposed a
flight ban from 4 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 to close all borders, leading to a record of
zero foreign tourists in the second and third quarters of the year, contracted by 100%.
Phuket, Bangkok, and Chonburi were the most affected provinces because their economic
growth heavily depended on foreign tourists. In 2021, the situation began to improve in
the fourth quarter because of the subsided domestic outbreak situation, the relaxation
of control measures, the progress on vaccine distribution, and the domestic traveling
stimulus scheme. The number of foreign tourists increased from the low base last year,
mainly owing to the implementation of the Test and Go program for international visitors
and the easing of international travel restrictions in tourist-origin countries.
In contrast with the economic decline during the pandemic, Thailand’s natural resources
and ecosystems have recovered from degrading conditions caused by intensive
tourism-related activities and swarming tourists in major ecological visiting sights
exceeding the environment’s carrying capacity. Particularly in the coastal and marine areas,
the study shows that seawater condition has improved, and coral bleaching has decreased.
Keystone species indicating the abundance of marine ecosystems have also increased,
such as Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris), leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys
coriacea), sea cows (Dugong dugon), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), and
blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus). Similarly, after the natural parks were
closed with no tourism activities, plant species flourished, and rarely appeared animal
species were frequently detected.
With the lesson learned from the pandemic and aligning with SDG 8—Promote sustained,
inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent
work for all—Thailand seeks to strengthen sustainable tourism and enhance diverse
socio-cultural identities as cultures, traditions, and community livelihood. Thailand aims
for quality and green tourism, environmentally friendly tourism that enhances natural
conservation and sustainable exploitation of natural resources.

1.5.5 Health
Since 2019, Thailand has suffered from the COVID-19 epidemic. As of 16 March 2022,
Thailand has 3,250,642 infected patients, 23,918 deceased, and 126,267,971 vaccine
recipients. In contrast, the NESDC report shows a general decline of 67.9% across all
other diseases. Surveillance diseases (i.e., Measles, Meningococcal Fever, Encephalitis,
Cholera, Hands, Feet, and Mouth, Dysentery, Pneumonia, Leptospirosis, Dengue Fever,
Influenza, and Rabies) decreased by 54.5% from 2020. The most significant fall was
the Hands, Feet, and Mouth disease, with a drop of more than 95.8%. The decline in
other diseases was due to the reduced social interaction under social distancing measures.
For coping with and adapting to climate change impacts on health, the Department of
Health (DOH) has initiated Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP), Phase 1 (2021–2030).
It functions as a crucial guideline enabling the multisectoral partnership to strengthen
and build health resilience from climate change. The objective is to reduce illness, lessen
health impacts, and become a center for health and climate change in Asia in climate
change-induced health risk management. HNAP focuses on 4 strategies: i) strengthening
the community and their skills in adaptation and health literacy to cope with health risks
from climate change; ii) integrating the resources of all sectors to drive public health
implementation of climate change proficiently; iii) strengthening public health preparedness
for climate change to support economic and social development and security;
and iv) developing the national public health system in response to climate change on an
international standard. With the support of WHO Thailand, the DOH developed a
monitoring standard and publication on health risks from the heat by using information
from medical diagnoses and death investigations. It also gathered information from
the public during the summer season by using a health poll. The information received
was used for planning and producing educational tools on health care and prevention
for the public. From 2020 to 2022, the health care system has been strengthened to
reach the standard of “Green and Clean Hospital” and “Low Carbon and Resilient Smart
Health Care.”
Thailand has also made progress with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3)—Ensure
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Lesson learned from the COVID-19
pandemic: The Ministry of Public Health has strengthened the readiness and capacity of
health service systems to monitor and evaluate the situation and infection risk and provide
early warning and control transmissions through sufficient diagnostic and investigation
tracking and quarantine systems. Strengthening the healthcare systems goes hand in
hand with the HNAP for climate resilience to prepare for climate change-induced
health risks.

1.5.6 Poverty and Inequality
Poverty
From 2017 to 2020, Thailand’s poverty line increased from 2,686 to 2,762 THB per
person per month. The strict measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19 have
led to an economic contraction. The number of poor people in 2020 totaled 4.8 million,
representing a poverty rate of 6.84%, up from 6.24% in 2019, or only 0.5 million up from
the previous year.

Figure 1-22: Poverty line, poverty rate and number of poor 2014-2020

Thailand has also implemented several measures to assist those affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures prioritize providing a financial
remedy of 5,000 THB per month for 3 months for workers in the informal sector and
agricultural producers. A remedy of 1,000 THB per person per month has also been
provided for other vulnerable groups. The Government has also initiated the “50:50
Co-Payment Scheme” to assist people with the cost of living in tandem with reducing
prices for essential goods. To revive the economy and alleviate the socio-economic
effects on vulnerable groups, Thailand has passed an emergency decree allowing
the Ministry of Finance to take out a loan of 1 trillion THB to resolve various problems,
provide a financial remedy for those affected, and boost socio-economic recovery
from the COVID-19 crisis. A strategy has also been developed to support increased
employment, boost income generation, and develop training to assist workers who

have recently returned to hometowns and communities because of the pandemic
to improve their livelihoods. Thailand is committed to creating a learning system
to “upskill” workers according to the needs of the labor market in the post-COVID
era, which will help workers adapt to the New Normal.
Inequality
In 2020, inequality slightly increased from the previous year. The Gini coefficient on
consumption expenditure in 2020 was 0.350, up from 0.348 in 2019. As the Government
maintains an average income of 13,473 THB per person per year or about 1,123 THB per
month, low-income earners can temporarily maintain their living costs.

Figure 1-23: Gini coefficient in Thailand, showing urban, rural and national levels 2009-2020
Remark: The Gini coefficient is a tool for measuring inequality, where the value is between 0 and 1. The closer the value
is to 1, the greater the income inequality.

Although poverty and inequality did not drastically increase, they are still issues that need
to be realized and given importance. If the Government’s aid runs out before the economy
and employment recover, poverty and inequality will become more severe. In the case of
poverty, it is estimated that without assistance, the number of poor people in 2020 will
total 11.02 million, representing 15.9% of the country’s population, meaning that there
will be 6 million more poor people. In the case of inequality, if there is no government
assistance, the Gini inequality coefficient is expected to increase from 0.350 to 0.383,
equal to the inequality situation in 2014. Thailand has made progress with SDG 1––End
poverty in all its forms everywhere and SDG 10—Reduce inequalities within and among
countries, with the following improvements:

CHAPTER 1
• Worker’s vulnerability reduction: Thailand amended relevant legislation to
provide increased benefits and rights to assistance for social protection covering
workers in the informal sector, self-employed persons, agricultural producers, informal
sellers, and freelance workers.
• Social welfare: In 2019, 46.05% of eligible persons were given a state welfare
card to support consumption costs for low-income groups, including transport costs,
rent, and household internet costs. The number of vulnerable groups with access to
social welfare was at a good level. In 2018, 84.5% of children from poor backgrounds
and disabled persons received financial assistance. In 2019, 81.7% of elderly persons
received state financial assistance.
• Multi-Dimension Poverty Index (MPI): The MPI for Thailand in 2019 was 0.051
improved from 0.068 in 2017.

1.5.7 Gender Equality
Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a peaceful,
prosperous, and sustainable world, according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG 5). Thailand has performed relatively well in SDG achievements. In July 2019,
the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung
Foundation placed Thailand as the top country among ASEAN members for its
overall SDG achievements and the 40th rank in the world. The Gender Equality
Act was passed in 2015 after a legislative process that included a comprehensive
consultative process between officials from the Department of Women’s Affairs and Family
Development, women’s civil society organizations, and LGBTI civil society organizations
before the National Legislative Assembly approved it. It is currently the most robust legal
instrument advocating for legal gender recognition in Thailand. This law intends to
protect people from unjust discrimination and provide access to legal processes equally,
whether the person is male, female, or a member of a “sexual diversity group.” Section 3
of the Act explicitly defines “gender discrimination” while clarifying that it is not limited
to men and women but also applies to persons who have “a different appearance from
his/her own sex by birth.”
Though Thailand has not yet ascertained the climate change impacts on gender inequality
in the national context, Thailand acknowledges the significance of integrating the gender
equality dimension into climate change policy, planning, and administrative structure to
fully achieve climate resilience and create an enabling environment for social participation
in climate change action. Thailand seeks to integrate the concept of Gender and Social
Inclusion (GSI) into the climate change context to ensure that 1) climate approaches are
more inclusive, efficient, responsive, and provide broader and equitable benefits to all
groups of people, especially the most vulnerable, 2) all population groups have equal
opportunities to participate and act as active agents of change in decision-making and

34

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
implementation at the national, regional, and local levels of adaptation and mitigation,
3) where gender and social equity gaps exist in the distribution of power, resources,
services, and participation, disadvantaged groups are supported and empowered to
overcome social, cultural, or institutional constraints and barriers to meaningful engagement.
The GSI integration in Thailand is at the initial stage. Notable initiatives can be illustrated
as follows:
• The Department of Women’s Affairs and Family Development (DWF), as a
principal national mechanism for the promotion of gender equality and women’s
empowerment in Thailand, ONEP, and the Sustainable Development Foundation jointly
organize a gender equality course for executive administrators to build capacity for
Chief Gender Equality Officers (CGEOs) and Gender Focal Points (GFPs) on a gender
approach to climate change adaptation.
• The DWF conducts a study, formulates a report, and holds workshop sessions
on GSI integration in climate change mitigation, focusing on the connection between
the commitments under the UNFCCC and gender dimensions and Thailand’s policies
related to climate change and gender. The objective is to provide guidelines and
recommendations on climate change implementation equitable for all and social and
gender-inclusive.
• The Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP)
and the Office of Agriculture Economics (OAE) have initiated pilot activities to conduct
and collaborate on GSI-climate vulnerability and impact assessment on a small scale
and to develop an effective model to integrate GSI into climate-related project
formulation, management, and budgeting. These projects were conducted in two
provinces, Maha Sarakham and Uthai Thani which are vulnerable to repeated droughts
and floods, relying on agriculture as the only source of income, and diverse in terms of
demography. The projects aimed to conduct participatory action research and GSI-CC
data collection with community engagement and multi-stakeholder consultations. The
projects revealed critical challenges in three areas: 1) improve researchers’ understanding
of GSI perspective to conduct participatory action research and data collection;
2) enhance institutional capacity building to improve government officials’ understanding
of how GSI relates to climate change impacts and actions; 3) obtain leadership support
to mobilize various governmental agencies and key stakeholders.

1.6.2 Institutional Arrangements of National Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Calculations of the national GHG inventory to report in the Fourth National
Communication (NC4) have been made in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The key components in estimating GHG
emissions are activity data and emission factors. Activity data is sourced from
a collaboration between the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and
Planning (ONEP) and lead agencies of the following 5 sectors.
1. Energy: led by the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) and the Office of
Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP)
2. IPPU: led by the Department of Industrial Works (DIW)
3. IPPU: led by the Department of Industrial Works (DIW)

39

CHAPTER 1

4. LULUCF: led by the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant
Conservation (DNP)
5. Waste: led by the Pollution Control Department (PCD).
After these lead agencies have collected activity data according to ONEP’s required
template from relevant agencies responsible for data collection (e.g., agencies under their
supervisions, local governments, and the private sector), the GHG emission is calculated
by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory System (TGEIS). Results will then be
interpreted into graphs and tables according to reporting format laid out by UNFCCC.
Results from TGEIS will then be submitted to 5 working groups, comprising appointed
representatives of the 5 sectors outlined above. Each working group then reviews the
methodology of the GHG emission estimation as part of quality control (QC) to ensure
that GHG emission estimates for their sectors are valid, accurate, and complete.
Following this, the GHG inventories of the 5 sectors are submitted to the Climate Change
Knowledge and Database Subcommittee for verification.
Finally, as the Secretariat of the NCCC, ONEP will submit the final GHG inventories as
part of the BUR to the NCCC for approval before submission to UNFCCC. For a complete
list of the sub-sectoral support agencies under each leading sector (see Figure 1-25).
The lead agencies and their responsibility in reporting data activity are as follows:
Energy: EPPO and OTP are the 2 lead agencies responsible for gathering the data from
relevant agencies within the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Transport, and others.
The activity data used for GHG emissions calculations are derived from fossil fuel/
electricity consumption used in different activities.
Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU): DIW is the lead agency responsible for
gathering the data from relevant agencies within the Ministry of Industry and others.
The activity data used for GHG emissions calculations are each industry group’s
production volume, import volume, and export volume.
Agriculture: OAE is the lead agency responsible for gathering the data from relevant
agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and others. The activity data
used for GHG emissions calculations are derived from livestock farming, rice cultivation,
agricultural soils, field burning, and the open burning of agricultural residues.
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF): DNP is the lead agency responsible
for gathering the data from relevant agencies within the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MONRE) and others. The activity data used for GHG emissions calculations
are derived from land use, land-use change, and wood product.
Waste: PCD is the lead agency responsible for gathering the data from relevant agencies
within the MONRE and others. The activity data used for GHG emissions calculations are
derived from sources of waste, waste production rate, waste composition, and wastewater
volume, including Emission Factors.

1.6.3 Institutional Arrangements of Domestic Measurement Reporting and
Verification (MRV) System
To monitor the implementation progress of the NAMA Roadmap, Thailand has developed
a domestic MRV system, which operates according to the following structure:
National level:
• The Working Group on GHG Inventory and Mitigation Measures is responsible
for 1) selecting appropriate measures/policies for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of
GHG emissions reduction, identifying Coefficient/Emission Factors, and implementing
MRV processes for activity data, and 2) reviewing and providing feedback on the GHG
emissions reduction report.
• Subcommittee on Climate Change Knowledge and Database is responsible for
further approval of the pre-approved report submitted the sectoral level.
• National Committee on Climate Change Policy (NCCC) is responsible for
the final approval of the GHG emissions reduction report, which will later be included in
national reports, the Biennial Update Report (BUR) and National Communication (NC).
Sectoral level:
• The main agencies at the sectoral level are responsible for the verification of
the following key data and approaches after the finalization by the working groups
on GHG inventory and mitigation measures as follows: 1) the appropriate measures/
policies for M&E of GHG emissions reduction, 2) the methodology for calculating GHG
emissions reduction, 3) MRV process for activity data, and 4) the final results and GHG
emissions reduction report.
The structure of the domestic MRV system is shown in Figure 1-26.

CHAPTER 2:

NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS
INVENTORY

Thailand National Greenhouse Gas Inventory reported in this NC4 was prepared using
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
In 2018, total GHG emissions (excluding those from LULUCF) were 372,648.77 GgCO2eq
and Net GHG emissions were 286,680.47 GgCO2eq (including those from LULUCF).
The Energy sector remained the most significant contributor to Thailand’s GHG
emissions, accounting for 69.06 % of the total GHG emissions. The share of emissions from
the Agriculture, IPPU, and Waste sectors were 15.69%, 10.77 %, and 4.48%, respectively.
LULUCF contributed to a net removal of -85,968.30 GgCO2eq.

2.1 Inventory Process in Thailand
2.1.1 Scope of Thailand National Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Thailand’s GHG inventory was developed and submitted according to Article 4.1(a)
of the Convention that requires a party to develop, periodically update, publish, and
make available to the Conference of the Parties, in accordance with Article 12, national
inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all
greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
The inventory report was prepared using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories and presented Thailand’s national GHG emissions from
2000 to 2018 by sources and removals by sinks. The GHG emissions estimated in this
report include both direct emissions Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide
(N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) and indirect emissions
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methane Volatile Organic
Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2).
2.1.2 Methodology for GHG Emissions and Removals Calculation
Overall, this GHG inventory report has improved on the previous submission. All
the methodologies and tools used for GHG inventory reporting followed the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines, LULUCF Good practice guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change, and
Forestry (referred to as GPG 2003), as well as the IPCC’s 2000 Good Practice Guidance
and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (referred to as
GPG 2000).

46

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Either Tier 1 or Tier 2 methodologies were applied wherever activity data and countryspecific emission factors were available. Tier 1 methodologies were employed for all
activity data in the Energy sector and almost all in Industrial Processes and Product Use
(IPPU) sector. Tier 2 was adopted in most categories under the Agriculture, Land Use,
Land-Use Change, and Forestry, and Waste sectors and some categories under the IPPU
sector. GHG emissions from the Energy and IPPU sectors were calculated using default
emission factors provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. When available, country-specific
emission factors were used for some sub-sectors of the LULUCF, Agriculture, and Waste
sectors.
The Global Warming Potential (GWP), as recommended by the IPCC, was used to
convert GHGs other than CO2 to CO2eq. The use of GWP was provided by the IPCC in
its Fourth Assessment Report based on the effects of GHGs over a 100-year time horizon.
The values were applied for the 5 direct GHG gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, and SF6.
The indirect gases, including NOx, CO, NMVOCs, and SO2, have been calculated and
reported.
2.1.3 Uncertainty Analysis
The inventories are prepared in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Thus, they typically contain a wide range of emission
calculations. Results of the uncertainty analysis of the data showed that the uncertainties
of Thailand’s national GHG inventory when including data on LULUCF for 2000 and 2018
are approximately 9.36 and 19.53, respectively. When the LULUCF was excluded from
the analysis, uncertainties were approximately 3.67 for 2000 and 7.32 for 2018.

2.1.4 Key Category Analysis
Key category analysis presents the importance of emission sources and sinks. The “key
categories” are defined as the emission sources and sinks that constitute 95% of total
annual emissions when ranked from greatest to lowest contribution. A “key source” has
a significant influence on the national inventory of direct GHG emissions in terms of the
absolute emissions level. The KCA reported in this inventory follows the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and is estimated for both level and
trend assessments. The results of the 2018 level assessment are presented in Table 2-2, and
those of the 2018 trend assessment are available in Table 2-3. There are 17 key categories
in the level assessment, among which main activity electricity and heat production led
the KCA, followed by road transportation, cropland remaining cropland, manufacturing
industries and construction, and rice cultivation. Results of the KCA changed slightly under
trend assessment, where land converted to cropland, forest land remaining forest land,
cropland remaining cropland, main activity electricity and heat production and rice
cultivation.

2.1.5 Time Series Consistency
Activity data for each source category presented in this inventory was based on the same
sources as the national statistics for all years (2000-2018). The same emission factors were
also used, in line with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Thus, this inventory allows for consistent
comparison of data points across time, with good confidence in the emission trends.
2.1.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
As dictated by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA)
procedures were implemented during the preparation of this inventory. In addition, Thailand
has utilized its own national system for quality control of data collection among ministerial
agencies (Chapter 1, Figure 1 -28). Data was controlled at each stage of the data collection
process by each respective institute and further underwent a final quality assurance process
conducted by the lead agency for each sector.
To fulfill transparency, accuracy, comparability, consistency, and completeness of national
GHG inventory, the Energy, IPPU, Agriculture, and Waste sectors have developed and
implemented the Quality Control (QC) procedure for verifying activity data (AD) and
activity data factor (ADF) in the recent Thailand’s GHG inventory system. The developed
QC procedure followed the recommendations from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and was
modified with relevant agencies’ suggestions. The QC-AD list consists of 1) completeness
of data, 2) data fluctuation based on historical data, 3) availability of data for the entire
time series, 4) comparable information from other sources, and 5) correction of data
structure. The QC-ADF list contains 1) check an applicable value as recommended in
IPCC 2006 Guidelines and 2) refer to international and/or national references. The QC
templates, simply operated on MS Excel, are used to support the relevant agencies for
inspecting the activity data.
2.2 Key Findings from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory
In this report, the trends of Thailand’s GHG emissions for the period 2000 to 2018, from
all emission sources and removals, were conducted according to the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines. The GHG emissions are estimated from the Energy, IPPU, Agriculture, LULUCF,
and Waste sectors which include both direct and indirect emissions. Direct GHGs consist
of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) whereas indirect GHGs consist of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx),
Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulfur
Dioxide (SO2). Table 2-4 shows Thailand’s national GHG inventory from 2000 to 2018.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
2.2.1 The Trend of Thailand’s GHG Emissions and Removals by Sector 2000-2018
Total GHG emissions (excluding those from LULUCF) increased from 245,899.56
GgCO2eq in 2000 to 372,648.77 GgCO2eq in 2018, with an average annual increase of
2.34%. The net removal of CO2 increased from -45,443.60 GgCO2eq in 2000 to -85,968.30
GgCO2eq in 2018. Net GHG emissions therefore increased overall from 200,455.96
GgCO2eq in 2000 to 286,680.47 GgCO2eq in 2018, with an average annual increase of
2.01% (Table 2-4, Figure 2-1). Between 2000-2018, the main source of GHG emissions
was the Energy sector, which saw an increase of 55.88% from 165,092.40 GgCO2eq in
2000 to 257,340.89 GgCO2eq in 2018. The proportion of GHG emissions in the Energy
sector accounted for 67.14% of total emission sources in 2000, increasing to comprise
69.06% of total emission sources in 2018. In the same period, the share of emissions
from the Agriculture sector decreased from 19.95% in 2000 to 15.69% in 2018, the IPPU
sector increased from 8.65% in 2000 to 10.77% in 2018 and the shares of emissions from
the Waste sectors slightly increased from 4.26% in 2000 to 4.48% in 2018. (Figure 2-2).

2.2.3 Recalculation of Total GHG Emissions
Previous inventories submitted in the BUR3 were calculated using the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines. To provide a consistent data series, recalculations were performed for past
inventories (2000-2016). As part of this current inventory submission, emissions for
the period 2000-2016 were recalculated using updated activity data, revised
emission factors, and subsectors according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Results of
the recalculated national GHG emissions data for 2000-2016 are presented in Figure 2-3.
The newly calculated emissions for 2000-2016 were higher than those in the previous
inventories submitted in the BUR3, in the range of an additional 0.06% to 1.82%.

2.3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector
2.3.1 Energy
2.3.1.1 Methodology
The method used in the calculation of Thailand’s greenhouse gas emissions is
mainly based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines of National Greenhouse Gas Inventories in
compliance with the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2000 (GPG 2000). The method of emissions
calculation in the energy sector is Tier 1.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
2.3.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018
Total direct GHG emissions from the Energy sector in 2018 were estimated to be 257,340.89
GgCO2eq. The majority of GHG emissions in the Energy sector were generated by fuel
combustion, consisting mostly of 1A1 Energy industries at around 103,055.20 GgCO2eq
(40.05%). GHG emissions from Transport, Manufacturing Industries and Construction,
and other sectors were 75,029.65 GgCO2eq (29.16%), 52,078.20 GgCO2eq (20.24%),
and 16,884.56 GgCO2eq (6.56%).
Fugitive Emissions from fuel comprised only 10,293.28 GgCO2eq or a little over 4.00%
of total GHG emissions from the Energy sector. Details of GHG emissions in the Energy
sector by gas type and source in 2018 are presented in Figure 2-4 and Table 2-6.

IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006), Good Practice
Guidance, and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC,
2000). The GHG emission calculation for IPPU Sector was Tier 1 approach as the primary
basis and Tier 1,2 for Cement Production.
2.3.2.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018
Total direct GHG emissions from the IPPU sector in 2018 were estimated at 40,118.18
GgCO2eq. The majority of GHG emissions in the IPPU sector were generated by
the Mineral Industry (2A) at around 20,574.46 GgCO2eq (51.28%), mainly consisting of
Cement Production at around 19,361.06 GgCO2eq. The followings were GHG emissions
from the Chemical Industry (2B) and Product Uses as Substitutes for Ozone Depleting
Substances (2F) at 13,307.30 GgCO2eq (33.17%) and 5,347.09 GgCO2eq (13.33%),
respectively. GHG emissions from the Metal Production (2C), Non-Energy Products from
Fuels (2D), and Other Product Manufacture and Use (2G) accounted for only 2% of total
GHG emissions from the IPPU sector.

2.3.3 Agriculture
2.3.3.1 Methodology
In this inventory, the methodologies used for the Agriculture sector were based on
the 2006 IPCC guidelines. GHG estimations were calculated for 2 sub-categories,
including 3A Livestock (3A1 Enteric fermentation and 3A2 Manure management) and
3C Aggregate sources and non-CO2 emission sources on land (3C1b Biomass burning
(Cropland), 3C2 Liming, 3C3 Urea fertilization, 3C4 Direct N2O emissions from managed
soils, 3C5 Indirect N2O emissions from managed soils, 3C6 Indirect N2O emissions from
manure management, and 3C7 Rice cultivation). Sub-categories 3C2, 3C3, and 3C6 were
estimated for the first time in this inventory. Methodology tiers were chosen according to
the decision trees in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Tier 1 and tier 2 methods were applied
to the Agriculture sector.
2.3.3.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018
Total GHG emissions from the Agriculture Sector in 2018 were 58,486.02
GgCO2eq. Livestock contributed 13,115.64 GgCO2eq (22.43%), comprising 10,052.24
GgCO2eq from enteric fermentation, 2,494.12 and 569.27 GgCO2eq for direct and indirect
manure management, respectively. Meanwhile, crop related-GHG emissions accounted
for 45,370.38 GgCO2eq (77.57%). Rice cultivation was the main GHG contributor in
Thailand’s Agriculture sector, at 29,990.25 GgCO2eq (51.28%). Agricultural soils emitted
11,974.34 GgCO2eq (20.47%) with direct and indirect emissions contributing 8,715.01
and 3,259.34 GgCO2eq, respectively. Field burning of agricultural residues and urea
fertilizer contributed similar GHG emissions of 1,706.82 and 1,671.38 GgCO2eq (2.92
and 2.86 %), respectively. The lowest agricultural GHG emission in 2018 was from liming
(27.59 GgCO2eq or 0.05%). Details of 2018 GHG emissions in the Agriculture sector by
gas type and source are presented in Figures 2-6 and Tables 2-8.
In the Agriculture sector, field burning of agricultural residues was estimated based on
the residues being burnt as residue management in croplands. This field burning was in
the category of “3C1b Emissions from Biomass Burning in Cropland (Cropland Remaining
Cropland)” in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

2.3.4 Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF)
2.3.4.1 Methodology
All methodologies and tools used to report GHG inventories for Land Use, Land-Use
Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) were consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006), Good Practice Guidance for
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2003), and Good Practice Guidance
and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2000).
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines define six land-use categories: forest land, cropland, grassland,
wetlands, settlements, and other lands. GHG emissions/removals from the LULUCF
sector during 2000-2018 were estimated for the three land categories (excluding
grassland, wetlands, and settlements). The Tier 2 methodology was used primarily
wherever activity data and country-specific emission factors were available. Approach 1
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was adopted for representing land-use areas of which total
land-use areas in each stratification were reported without data on conversions between
land uses.
2.3.4.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018
The total CO2 emissions/removals from C stock changes for each land use category is
the sum of those from these all sub-categories taking into account the three carbon
pools: (i) above-ground biomass, (ii) below-ground biomass, and (iii) dead organic matter
(deadwood and litter). The LULUCF sector in Thailand showed a trend of increased net
removals because the total removals exceeded the total emissions. LULUCF activities
contributed to a tremendous increase in net removal from the atmosphere since 2000
due to the net removal of rubber plantations. It can be observed that cropland dominates
the net removals estimated for the LULUCF sector for Thailand. The net removals in the
period of 2000 –2014 fluctuated due to the net removals from cropland and emissions
from land conversion, but it seemed stable after 2015.
In 2018, the LULUCF sector contributed to a net removal of 85,968.30 GgCO2eq,
accounting for an increase by two folds compared with the year 2000. The net removal
estimated for cropland remaining cropland was 68,806.14 GgCO2eq, accounting for
almost 80% of the overall net removals of the LULUCF sector. The forest land conversion
emitted 9,502.20 and 119.46 GgCO2eq from land converted to cropland and other lands,
respectively, thereby decreasing about 60% compared with the emissions in 2000. While
non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in the LULUCF sector emitted 19.52 GgCO2eq.
Details of GHG emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector by gas type and source in 2018
are presented in Figure 2-7 and Table 2-9.
In the LULUCF sector, non-CO2 emissions were estimated from biomass burning from
an uncontrolled forest fire in natural forest (3B1a Forest Land Remaining Forest Land)
and forest converted to cropland (3B2b Land Converted to Cropland) and to other lands
(3B6b Land Converted to other lands) in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

2.3.5 Waste
2.3.5.1 Methodology
The methodologies and tools used for GHG inventory reporting followed the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006). In the Waste sector,
the methodologies used varied from Tier 1 to Tier 2, depending on types of activity data
and emission factors. Tier 2 was adopted for solid waste disposal and Tier 1 for the rest.
2.3.5.2Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018
GHG emissions in the Waste sector were mainly from solid waste disposal, at 8,774.67
GgCO2eq (52.53%), and wastewater treatment and discharge, at 7,635.72 GgCO2eq
(45.71%). Waste incineration accounted for 180.54 GgCO2eq (1.08%), while biological
treatment of solid waste was the smallest proportion of total GHG emissions in this
sector, with an amount of 112.76 GgCO2eq (0.68%). Details of GHG emissions in

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

2.4 Constraints, Gaps, and Needs in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory by Sector
Thailand aims to improve its inventory quality in terms of transparency, accuracy,
completeness, consistency, and comparability. During the national GHG inventory
development, Thailand faced several constraints and gaps that needed to be addressed.
This includes limitations and barriers that affect the quality of GHG inventory estimation
and compilation. It is important to improve the quality of the national statistics compiled
by relevant agencies to further improve the overall quality of the national GHG inventory.
Further work and support are needed to improve the inventory quality, particularly in
terms of transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability.
Enhancing the knowledge and understanding of GHG estimation methodologies among
key stakeholders, particularly industrial partners, including training on sensitivity analysis
and calculation, is also needed to strengthen the national GHG inventory development.
The capacity building and technology transfer should be provided to relevant government
agencies and relevant agencies.
The existing TGEIS database also needs to be updated periodically to reflect
the progress of GHG inventory quality. COP26 decisions have determined that under the
implementation of ETF, the national GHG inventory must follow the Common Reporting
Tables format. To prepare for this reporting format, Thailand is updating our national
GHG inventory system (TGEIS) and planning for an annual training workshop for relevant
officers. Moreover, Climate Change Bill is being drafted. This will become a regulatory
framework that enables relevant agencies in the government and private sectors to collect
required data for the national GHG inventory, especially those not currently available.
2.4.1 Energy
There are two key areas of support needed: 1) activity data and 2) emission factors which
can be summarized as follows:
• Country-specific emission factors should be developed and introduced for
the main fuels used in Thailand, including biofuels.
• Although Thailand has already adopted the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in all sectors,
Thailand needs to enhance the professional capacities of national experts involved in
the inventory process. A transition from default emission factors and Tier 1
methodologies to country-specific emission factors and Tier 2 and 3 methodologies is
needed, focusing mainly on key categories.

67

CHAPTER 2
With international level supports through bilateral collaboration and international
organizations, Thailand’s national inventory has been drastically improved in the
calculation and reporting in all sectors. However, several supports needed remain, which
can be identified by sector, as follows.
The main areas of support needed in the Energy sector are:
• The Ministry of Transport, via the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), is
developing an approach to collect data on fuel consumption for international aviation.
2.4.2 Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU)
Gaps, needs, and areas of improvement in preparing Thailand’s National GHG inventory
in the IPPU sector and using TGEIS can be identified below:
• Estimation of GHG emissions from the IPPU sector is considered a challenge
for Thailand due to the diversity of GHG sources and gas types and the complexity
of calculation methodologies and data requirements. Currently, the emissions from
most sub-categories under the IPPU sector can be estimated using the Tier1 approach
with adequate activity data and default EF values. Tier2 estimation is only possible for
the cement industry, in which country-specific emission factors are available. For
other sub-categories, specific emission factors need to be developed in order to shift to
a more accurate Tier2 estimation.
• Currently, F-gases are estimated and included in Thailand’s GHG emission
inventory. There are many limitations and difficulties in data collection and classification
and a lack of specific technical data, such as initial charge, lifetime of equipment, and
emission factors. Thailand’s Department of Industrial Works has imposed reporting
requirements on F-gases consumption and import-export statistics. However, such
aggregate data can be useful and possible for Tier 1 estimation. Improvement
of data reporting forms is underway to collect disaggregate data at application or
sub-application levels. Advanced techniques, such as monitoring and modeling
approaches, are also required to obtain the activity and emission data for F-gas estimation in
order to fulfill the gaps according to the 2006 IPCC guideline. In order to achieve more
accurate GHG estimations and adopt the higher IPCC methodologies in the IPPU sector,
the strengthening of data collection is required, particularly F-gas data.
2.4.3 Agriculture
Gaps, needs, and areas of improvement in the Agriculture sector preparing Thailand’s
National GHG inventory are as follows:
• To achieve more accurate GHG estimations and adopt the higher IPCC
methodologies in the Agriculture sector, the required data should be collected or
revised from the country. These include the updated livestock’s characteristics and
fractions of manure in management systems, determining more appropriate methods to
estimate areas burnt in croplands by using satellite images, the revised fractions of crop

68

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
residues, gathering lime application to croplands from private sector, determining fertilizer
application rates of major crops according to bottom-up approach, developing or
revising country-specific EFs for agricultural soils and rice cultivation with water
management (e.g., alternative wetting and drying).
• Due to the limitation in quality assurance or quality control (QA/QC) and
uncertainty of the country’s activity data and emission factors, improving the QA/
QC procedure and uncertainty analysis in these data may enhance the accuracy of
the inventory systems.
• Better understanding of the IPCC Guidelines, GHG estimation methodologies,
and quality control systems, e.g., via activities on capacity building and technical transfer,
should be provided for relevant government agencies and other parties. This may be
important for strengthening institutions' capacity in data collection, quality control of
data, and enhancing mitigation measures.
2.4.4 Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF)
Although the MRV systems for the LULUCF sector have been developed and
implemented among the relevant stakeholders, activity data relevant to forest land remains
incomplete because forest areas in the LULUCF sector involve multiple departments (i.e.,
Royal Forest Department and Forest Industry Organization). For instance, there is also
a gap between public and private data on forest plantation areas. In addition, activity data
for biomass burning in forest land reported by various departments remains unclear in
terms of burned areas and/or land categories. To provide more accurate GHG estimation
and adopt the higher IPCC methodologies, remote sensing-based monitoring of land
use and land cover is needed to classify types of natural forests and forest plantations,
monitor their changes, and detect forest area burning.
Although cropland and forest land are key land categories contributing to the GHG
net removals in the LULUCF sector, wood harvested from either cropland or forest
plantations is not reported except for those reported by Forest Industry Organization.
Thus, an approach must be developed for the government and private sector to enhance
the MRV systems of essential activity data for the LULUCF sector.
Country-specific values are applied in most LULUCF categories, but some emission
factors are adopted from IPCC defaults due to the use of the IPCC-2006 guidelines (i.e.,
below-ground to above-ground biomass ratio for natural forest and woody crops,
deadwood and organic litters, trace gases emission ratio and uncertainty estimation).
Furthermore, some parameters are not adequate to be used as national representatives
due to the limitation of information (i.e., country-specific values relevant to croplands).
Therefore, a new process for developing country-specific values is recommended to
improve the accuracy of GHG inventory and adopt higher methodologies for the LULUCF
sector.

69

CHAPTER 2

2.4.5 Waste
Although MRV systems in the Waste sector have been developed and implemented
among relevant stakeholders, some parameters are still out-of-date, such as solid waste
composition and annual per capita protein consumption. Other parameters are not
adequate to be used as nationally representative, including industrial production,
wastewater generated, and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in specific industrial
wastewater. Meanwhile, other parameters are not available altogether, such as the degree
of utilization of treatment discharge pathways or systems, including septic tanks, latrines,
sewers, centralized wastewater treatment, and no treatment. Therefore, data collection
systems and the creation of a centralized database need to be developed. Technical and
funding support is required for capacity building within relevant agencies.
Development of country-specific values of emission factors for solid waste disposal and
wastewater treatment and discharge of both domestic and industrial sources is also
needed to improve data collection according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This includes,
for example, reaction constants and half-lives in the degradation of specific compositions
of solid waste, the maximum methane producing capacity, and a methane correction
factor for the wastewater treatment and discharge system. Technical and funding support
is needed for initiating these studies.
Some cross-cutting issues need to be addressed, including archiving procedures,
the planning, development, and implementation of a QA/QC system, and a process for
uncertainty assessment.

CHAPTER 3:

MITIGATION MEASURES

Thailand has put all efforts within its capacity to uphold its commitment under
the Convention by integrating climate change mitigation into its national and sectoral
policies and plans and implementing mitigating measures to achieve the national GHG
reduction targets—NAMA’s target to reduce GHG emission by 7-20% from BAU by
2020 and NDC’s target to reduce GHG emission by 20-25% from BAU by 2030. Thailand
submitted the 2nd updated NDC, which aligns with an ambitious pledge to reduce GHG
emissions by 30 % from the BAU level by 2030. The contribution level increases to
40%, subject to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and
transfer, financial resources, and capacity-building support. Furthermore, Thailand will
continue efforts to meet the long-term goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero
GHG emissions by 2065.
This chapter lays out Thailand’s national, sectoral, and municipal mitigation policies and
plans. The national plans include the 20-Year National Strategy, 12th National Economic
and Social Development Plan, Climate Change Master Plan, Nationally Appropriate
Mitigation Action (NAMA), Thailand’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and
Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). Aligning
with the economy wide, the climate mitigation agenda is also incorporated into sectoral
plans in emission-intensive sectors—energy, transport, IPPU, and waste sectors.
Subsequently, this chapter sums up the overall implementation of NAMA’s measures,
its GHG reduction achievement, and the transition toward the NDC implementation. It
further illustrates other mitigation actions, including voluntary actions from the carbon
market and carbon label schemes which are increasingly developed.

The 20-Year National Strategy 2018 – 2037
The 20-Year National Strategy (2018-2037) is the country’s first national long-term
strategy developed pursuant to the Constitution Section 65 stipulating that the State
should develop a national strategy to be employed as the country’s goal for sustainable
national development in accordance with the principle of good governance. One of
the key strategies is the “Eco-Friendly Development and Growth,” aiming to
1) conserve and preserve natural resources and environment as well as culture for
the next generation’s sustainability, 2) restore and reconstruct natural resources and
the environment for mitigation of negative impacts that may arise from national
economic and social development, 3) ensure balanced utilization of the natural resource
and environmental base by balancing development with ecosystem capacity, and
4) ensure the country’s paradigm shift for the determination the country’s natural resources
and environment, as well as culture, based on good governance and public participation.
This development strategy seeks to achieve all development aspects of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), including promoting mutual growth in terms of the economy,
environment, and quality of life. The focus is to create balance among these three factors
to promote sustainability for future generations.
The National Strategy recognizes that climate change impacts have been anticipated to
intensify concerning variability, frequency, and coverage. Such impacts will inevitably
threaten lives, damage properties and necessary infrastructure, and affect agricultural
production and water security. At the same time, ecological systems are likely to
deteriorate. Given this recognition, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and values of
the bioeconomy are one of the key indicators for this development goal. The strategic
guideline to promote sustainable climate-friendly based society growth focuses on the
following points:
• Mitigation measures: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting
a low-carbon society, supporting agricultural management to benefit from greenhouse
gas reductions, accelerating the restoration of deteriorated forests, and expanding
forest areas to function as carbon storage areas.
• Adaptation measures: improving the overall disaster management system,
enhancing people’s capacity to cope with and adjust to any harmful impact caused by
climate change, and developing preparedness and response systems for emerging and
reemerging infectious diseases caused by climate change.
• Enabling measures: developing a database system, promoting low-carbon
products and services to systematically reinforce national competitiveness, developing
economic measures to incentivize investments that cope with climate change,
encouraging businesses to plan for climate change, and improving relevant laws to
drive climate change management.

CHAPTER 3
The 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021
The 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021 recognizes that
climate change and natural disasters have become more unpredictable and severe,
particularly floods and droughts, causing impacts on the economic sectors and the
domestic supply chain. Plus, international agreements on climate change and competitive
trade have intensified. Thus, the fourth strategy, "Strategy for Environmentally Friendly
Growth for Sustainable Development," seeks to improve greenhouse gas reduction and
adaptation capacity, lessen the impacts of climate change, and improve the response
to natural disasters. For this target, key indicators include: 1) the volume of greenhouse
gas emissions in the energy and transport sectors decreases by 7% compared to the
business as usual scenario for 2030, 2) the unit costs of GHG emissions reduction decrease
(THB per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent), 3) there are action plans for adaptation to
climate change in each of the priority sectors, such as water resources management,
agriculture, health and forestry, and 4) domestic climate change mitigation mechanisms
are established to provide support in terms of finance, technology, and capacity building.
The development guidelines to support greenhouse gas reduction as well as enhance
adaptive capacity to climate change are as follows:
• Draft and amend laws and regulations related to climate change so that they can
respond to international climate change agreements in an integrated and comprehensive
manner.
• Prescribe measures and mechanisms to support greenhouse gas reduction in all
sectors, emphasizing the following sectors: electricity generation, transport, industry,
households, and buildings. Reduce the use of fossil fuels in generating power while
promoting renewable energy, energy-saving, and waste-to-energy. Build the capacity of
the workforce to excel in various forms of renewable energy. Support sustainable transport
systems, and increase the efficiency of engines, machines, and instruments. Foster the
establishment of financial mechanisms between the public and private sectors in order
to support climate change actions that generate co-benefits. Moreover, encourage the
private sector to invest more in greenhouse gas reduction.
• Promote the private sector, state enterprises, and local administrations to collect
and report information regarding greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from energy usage.
• Enhance the capacity of R&D in science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) to
support climate change adaptation.
• Create knowledge and understanding and raise awareness and public participation
from all stakeholders in response to climate change impacts.

CHAPTER 3
Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050)
Aligning with the 20-Year National Strategy and the 12th National Economic and Social
Development Plan, Thailand’s Climate Change Master Plan (CCMP) aims for Thailand to
be resilient to the impacts of climate change and achieves low carbon growth through
sustainable development. The objectives of the plan are 1) to provide a long-term national
framework for climate change adaptation and low carbon growth promotion according
to the sustainable development principle; 2) to provide a policy framework for
the development of mechanisms and tools at the sectoral and national level, to achieve
effective resolutions for climate change, 3) to provide government agencies and relevant
organizations with a framework for detailed action plans; facilitating awareness and mutual
understanding by means of a common framework of reference points, thereby increasing
integration and reducing redundant processes, 4) to provide budgeting agencies with
a clear framework for budget allocation, thus enabling the mobilization of concrete
climate change resolutions. The Master Plan also consists of three key strategies: climate
change adaptation, mitigation, low carbon development, and enabling environment on
climate change management. The implementation of these three strategies is divided
into three phases: short-term 2016, medium-term 2020, and long-term 2050. The CCMP
is subject to be revised according to the updated Nationally Determined Contribution
and Long-Term Strategy Target.
The CCMP Strategy 2 “Mitigation and low carbon development” comprises actions and
measures in the following eight sectors:
• Power generation and energy supply—focusing on decreasing fossil fuel
consumption, increasing/developing renewable energy production, and developing
infrastructure which facilitates low carbon development while simultaneously lowering
GHG emissions
• Transport—focusing on increasing the efficiency of transport and logistics,
developing low carbon transport infrastructure, and applying sustainable principles to
manage transport demand
• Energy consumption in buildings—focusing on improving energy conservation
and efficiency in buildings
• Industry—focusing on improving the performance of machinery, energy efficiency,
and waste reduction through measures such as the promotion of renewable energy
production and consumption, and investments in low-carbon and environmentally friendly
industries
• Waste management—focusing on integrated life cycle waste management by
prioritizing source reduction and the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) in accordance with
the waste hierarchy. Waste management efficiency will be increased by supporting
waste-to-energy programs.
• Agriculture—focusing on low emission agricultural practices with environmental
and financial co-benefits; increasing the capacity of farmers to accommodate GHG
reduction technologies and management systems

78

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
• Forestry—focusing on creating carbon sinks via forest conservation, restoration,
reforestation, and afforestation. Measures that affect communities in forested areas
should be evaluated on the merits of their environmental and social impact via public
hearings of sufficient duration and transparency, which will ultimately aid the decision
and policy-making processes.
• Urban management—focusing on increasing urban green spaces to act as carbon
and pollution sinks which can also help mitigate GHG emissions from human activities
in major cities

Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)
Thailand’s GHG mitigation goal committed to UNFCCC can be divided into 2 phases:
Pre-2020 and Post-2020. For the Pre-2020, Thailand’s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation
Action (NAMA) pledged in 2014 to reduce national GHG emissions in the range of 7-20%
from the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario in the energy and transport sectors by 2020,
subject to the level of international support provided. The details of the NAMA Roadmap
and its progress were reported in the BUR3. Thailand implemented NAMA Roadmap
and Action Plan and achieved a GHG emission reduction target. The overall NAMA
implementation will be illustrated in section 3.2, “Mitigation Measures,” of this chapter.

Thailand’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
For the Post-2020, on 1 October 2015, Thailand submitted its Intended Nationally
Determined Contribution (INDC) to UNFCCC. It later launched Thailand’s Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) Roadmap and Action Plan in 2017, aiming to reduce
GHG emissions by 20-25% from the projected BAU level by 2030. The NDC Roadmap
established a framework for mitigation measures in Energy, Transport, IPPU, and Waste
sectors. To achieve the NDC targets, key agencies have developed NDC Sectoral Action
Plans on greenhouse gas mitigation corresponding to the NDC Roadmap to ensure
the achievement of the pledged target of a 20% reduction from the 2030 BAU. In addition,
key agencies, NDC sectoral focal points, developed the Supportive Action Plan, which
aims to create enabling environment to support the NDC implementation.

regional energy security according to the necessity and sufficiency to maintain
the stability of the electricity system, 3) renewable energy has an annual purchase policy under
the renewable energy generation policy, and it is purchased at a price not exceeding Grid
Parity to prevent the retail electricity price from rising, and 4) energy conservation policy can
prove convincing with quality and compete with price not exceeding the Grid Parity.
The NDC Sectoral Action Plan for energy sector 2021 – 2030 aims to reduce greenhouse
gases by at least 82 million tCO2 by 2030, compared to a business-as-usual case. The plan
laid down three strategies for greenhouse gas reduction operations: drive GHG reduction
in the energy sector, prepare a long-term strategy for GHG reduction in the energy sector,
and create a network of public, private, and public partnerships.

NDC Sectoral Action Plan for Transport Sector 2021 – 2030
The Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) has developed the NDC
Sectoral Action Plan for Transport Sector 2021 – 2030, aiming to reduce GHGs by millions
of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent with four key strategies: 1) supporting and promoting
the planned implementation of relevant agencies in the transport sector, 2) developing
and improving laws supporting GHG reduction, 3) developing measurement, reporting
and verification (MRV), and 4) engaging and strengthening the capacity of all agencies
to reduce GHGs. An emphasis is on developing efficient and sustainable transport
systems to reduce energy consumption in the transport sector, lessen traffic congestion,
create livable cities, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will lead to stable and
sustainable economic growth. Three key measures are as follows:
1) Avoid: developing policies that encourage people to avoid travel or reduce
unnecessary travel distances by integrating urban planning with appropriate transportation
planning, such as developing living spaces in compact areas, the development of the area
around transit-oriented development (TOD), and work-from-home measure promotion.
2) Switch: developing policies that encourage people to switch from using private
vehicles to more efficient and environmentally friendly forms of travel, including public
transport and motorless travel (cycling and walking).
3) Improve: developing policies that improve energy efficiency in motor vehicles
and fuel efficiencies such as automotive energy-saving technology, alternative energy
consumption, promoting gasohol oil consumption, and promoting electric vehicles and
bicycles.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
targets fordriving key measures and supporting measures to reduce GHG emissions in
the IPPU sector, including wastewater from industries to achieve the goal within the year
2030 according to NDC Roadmap and Action Plan.
The NDC Sectoral Action Plan for IPPU and industrial wastewater consists of three main
measures:
1) Clinker substitution measures with 2 sub-activities: the use of clinker substitutes
in the hydraulic cement production process and the increased use of cement substitutes
in ready-mixed concrete.
2) Refrigerant replacement measures with 2 sub-activities: refrigerant modification
under the RAC NAMA project and the proper disposal of waste and deteriorated
refrigerant.
3) Measures to manage industrial wastewater: consistent and have the potential
to reduce GHG emissions according to the NDC goals guideline, such as measures to
increase biogas production from industrial wastewater by reusing Methane gas according
to the Alternative Energy Development Plan 2015 – 2036 (AEDP2015), which sets goals
for the use of biogas from industrial wastewater, agricultural waste ranch, and community
waste to be utilized to generate electricity and heat.

NDC Sectoral Action Plan for Waste Sector 2021 – 2030
In conjunction with the relevant authorities, the Pollution Control Department (PCD) has
developed the NDC Sectoral Action Plan for Waste Sector 2021-2030, targeting to
reduce GHG emissions of 2.0 million tCO2eq from municipal solid waste and municipal and
industrial wastewater. 65% of this target (1.3 million tCO 2eq) is expected from
implementing measures in the municipal solid waste sector, while 35% (0.7 million tCO2eq)
is expected from implementing measures in wastewater management. The plan is divided
into 2 parts: 1) NDC Action Plan in the municipal waste management sector, prepared
by the Pollution Control Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment,
and 2) NDC Action Plan in the industrial processes and product use, including industrial
wastewater sector, prepared by the Department of Industrial Works, Ministry of Industry.
The prospective mitigation measures in municipal solid waste management include:
1) landfill gas utilization, 2) waste to energy, 3) composting, 4) semi-aerobic landfill, 5)
anaerobic digestion, and 6) mechanical biological treatment, whereas the potential
mitigation measure in industrial wastewater management is methane recovery from
industrial wastewater treatment. The MRV systems for implementation of NDC measures,
including landfill gas utilization, waste to energy, composting, and methane recovery
from industrial wastewater treatment, have been accomplished. Additionally, supportive
mechanisms for effective implementation of the sectoral action plans in the waste sector,
such as research and development, capacity building, and stakeholder engagement, are
being executed.

CHAPTER 3
Second Updated Thailand’s Nationally Determined Contribution (2nd Updated NDC)
At the World Leader Summit COP26 on 1 November 2021, Thailand’s Prime Minister
expressed Thailand’s intention to fully elevate climate mitigation measures by all means.
Thailand aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero Greenhouse Gas emissions
by 2065. Furthermore, Thailand aims to increase the NDC target to reduce 40% of GHG
emissions compared to BAU by 2030, given that the international community, through
the mechanism of the Convention, can provide necessary financial, technical, technology,
and capacity-building supports. Based on a more ambitious pledge, Thailand updated
the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas
Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDs) to reflect national targets aligning with
the Prime Minister’s statement. The 2nd Updated NDC was submitted to the UNFCCC
on 4 November 2022.
The revised NDC concept framework of Thailand is similar to that of Thailand’s LongTerm Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). The revised NDC
is carried out with reference to the planned implementation goals of each relevant
Ministry in the energy, IPPU, Agriculture, LULUCF, and waste management sectors. The
plans include the Energy Efficiency Plan 2018–2037 (EEP2018), the Alternative Energy
Development Plan 2018–2037 (AEDP2018), the Power Development Plan 2018–2037
No. 1 revised edition (PDP2018 Rev.1), and the guidelines for the promotion of electric
vehicles (EV) of the country according to the 30@30 policy. Measures from the agricultural
sector were incorporated into the revised NDC goal and guidelines to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. The revised NDC guidelines and measures include:
• Energy and transport sector: The energy sector has the most significant
potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It includes measures to increase
the energy efficiency of equipment/machines in power plants and renewable energy
utilization.
• IPPU sector, comprising clinker substitution measures and the refrigerant
replacement.
• Waste management sector consists of municipal solid waste management,
domestic wastewater management, and industrial wastewater management.
• Agriculture sector consists of fixed dome digester biogas production measures
and improvements in rice farming to reduce methane emissions.

Thailand’s Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS)
The implementation of Thailand’s Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission
Development Strategy is in accordance with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, which
requires all countries to develop and communicate a long-term strategy for low GHG
emission development to the UNFCCC Secretariat aiming to limit global temperature
from rising above 2°C or 1.5°C. Thailand sets long-term targets and guidelines for GHG
reduction toward carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero emission in 2065 by identifying
key measures in the sectors of energy, transport, IPPU, waste, agriculture, and LULUCF,
which is the GHG removal sector of the country, for relevant agencies and sectors to use
as operational guidelines.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
ONEP revised and updated LT-LEDS and NDC with support from the Deutsche
Gesellshaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH to study, improve, and
formulate a long-term strategy for the country’s low emissions development and set GHG
reduction targets under the NDC consistent with the Prime Minister’s statement at the
COP26 meeting. The revised LT-LEDS was submitted to the UNFCCC on 7 November
2022. The revised LT-LEDS sets goals and measures aligning with an increase in global
average temperatures of 1.5°C and moving toward carbon neutrality by 2050. It was
developed by using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model (AIMEnduse) to project
the long-term low-level greenhouse gas emissions, including remedial policy measures
for climate change adaptation action, and using a computable general equilibrium (AIM/
CGE) model to assess the economic and environmental impacts of energy policy and

National Industrial Development Master Plan 2012-2031
As climate change is one of the key factors affecting the changing dynamic of the Thai
industrial sector, National Industrial Development Master Plan 2012-2031 aims to achieve
sustainable production that takes into account social and environmental considerations
“Environmentally Friendly - Green and Clean.” The development in the industrial
sector should reflect a green growth industry, climate resilience society, and low
carbon society. Therefore, the industrial development framework in the master plan aims
to strike a balance between 4 dimensions: 1) Enhancing economic wealth and security,
2) Utilizing human wisdom for innovation and value creation for sustainable development,
3) Securing social well-being and reducing social inequality, and 4) Promoting
environmental wellness to raise public awareness for environmental conservation and
improving regulations and their enforcement to support environmentally friendly
production and eliminate negative externalities.

87

CHAPTER 3
Thailand’s Industrial Development Strategy 4.0 (2017-2036)
In the fourth phase of industrial development, Thailand seeks to shift the paradigm into
an innovative-driven economy targeting prosperity, security, and sustainability through
three mechanisms: productive growth engine, inclusive growth engine, and green
growth engine. The green growth engine focuses on environmentally friendly technology
development and renewable energy transition. The development perspective shifts from
cost advantage to loss advantage—considering the benefits of overall loss mitigation.
The cornerstone is ensuring that the production process internalizes the negative
externalities and minimizes adverse environmental effects. The green growth
engine solves the “inequitable development trap” between the environment and
human needs. The phases and mechanisms of industrial development in Thailand can

Green Industry
The Ministry of Industry launched Thailand’s Green Industry Initiative and established
two implementation guidelines:
1. Set guidelines and create a concrete green industry under two main concepts:
continuous improvement and sustainable development
2. Integrate environmentally relevant projects of all departments within the Ministry
of Industry under the green industry projects
Thailand’s Green Industry Initiative is implemented on a voluntary basis to conduct
business in a community and environmentally friendly manner for sustainable
development. Green industry means industry committed to continuously improving
production processes and environmentally friendly business management and
adhering to business operations with the responsibility to society both inside and

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
outside the organization throughout the supply chain. The Ministry of Industry
promotes the industry sector in Thailand to achieve environmentally and
socially friendly operations by encouraging establishments nationwide to integrate
environmentally friendly practices into business operations and continue to evolve
into green industries on 5 levels. The industries can acquire benefits according to
the level achieved such as using Green Industry logo or acquiring governmental
procurement. The 5 levels of implementation are as follows:
• Level 1: Green Commitment is a manifestation of commitment in the form of
policies, goals, and plans to reduce environmental impacts and have communications
within the organization.
• Level 2: Green Activity is the implementation of policies by having goals and
a roadmap to reduce environmental impacts in a concrete way and achieve the set
commitments.
• Level 3: Green System is systematic environmental management—monitoring,
evaluation, and review for continuous development or awarding recognized or accredited
environmental awards related to the conservation of resources and
environments.
• Level 4: Green Culture is when everyone in the organization has a common
conscience to preserve and maintain a good environment and cooperate in all aspects
of the business to be environmentally friendly and take action to become part of
the corporate culture.
• Level 5: Green Network is an extension of the scope of the green industry from
within the organization itself and throughout the supply chain by encouraging partners
to be part of the green industry.

3.1.2.4 Waste Sector
Draft National Waste Management Action Plan 2022-2027
The Draft National Waste Management Action Plan 2022 – 2027 was prepared as
a framework and guidelines to drive waste management operations to align with
the country’s development guidelines and the global context. The Action Plan is set to
frame new waste management for a clean environment and promote a sustainable society
and the following principles:
• Bio-Economy, Circular Economy, and Green Economy (BCG Model) consists of
three elements: 1) Bio-Economy aims to enhance technology and innovation to develop
biological resources or agricultural products such as the development of biodegradable
plastics (compostable plastics) or alternative plastic products from natural materials,
2) Circular economy focuses on bringing used resources or products back to the production
process again to be recycled or processed into a new product, creating value for waste
and reducing the amount of waste in the manufacturing sector to zero (Zero Waste), and
3) Green Economy promotes the use of environmentally friendly production technology
such as using bio-based substances instead of chemical pesticides. The BCG Model is
a strategy to develop the national economy by balancing economic growth and natural
resource sustainability.
• 3R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle): Reduce the waste generation at the source
in the process of design, production, and consumption, reuse the packaging waste or
waste material without processing or reprocessing, and recycle waste materials by
processing in the production process and produces a new product.
• Polluter Pays Principles (PPP): Economic tool used to manage natural resources
and the environment. The polluters must bear the cost of preventing damage to human
health or the environment.
• Public-Private Partnership: All sectors should participate in waste management
from production, import, distribution, consumption, and management at the destination,
which encourages the private sector to invest or jointly invest in the operation of a waste
management system.
• Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): The principle encourages producers
to take responsibility for their products after public consumption by jointly paying
the production handling fee and participating in waste recovery for reuse, recycling, and
environmentally safe disposal. It also encourages the producers to modify the design
and manufacturing process to be more environmentally friendly by reducing the use of
harmful substances in products and consider designing and manufacturing products that
will last a lifetime.
The objectives for implementing the National Waste Management Action Plan (2022 – 2027)
by the year 2027 seek to have 80% of solid waste properly managed, 60% of household
hazardous waste properly managed, 100% of infectious waste properly managed, and
100 % of hazardous industrial waste correctly processed in the management system.
The implementation measures focus on “Reduce and Enhance”—reducing the generation
of solid waste and hazardous waste at source and enhancing capacity to manage solid
waste and hazardous waste, promoting solid waste and hazardous waste management.

Thailand’s Roadmap on Plastic Waste Management 2018 – 2030
According to the Pollution Control Department report in 2019, the amount of plastic waste
was 1.91 million tons, and 0.36 million tons (about 19%) were recycled. The COVID-19
pandemic also intensifies theplastic waste problem. In addition, a 2021 UN comprehensive
assessment report, released before COP26, emphasized that plastics are a climate
problem. Plastics, the by-product of fossil fuels, contribute to GHG emissions throughout
the life cycle, from production to disposal. Acknowledging that plastic waste and the
climate change problems are intertwined, Thailand has formulated the Plastic Waste
Management Roadmap 2018-2030 to move toward sustainable plastic management
based on the principle of Circular Economy, seeking to serve as a framework and direction
for preventing and solving the plastic waste problem in the country. The roadmap’s
underlying principles include Circular Economy, Responsible Production and
Consumption, Public-Private Partnership, and Life Cycle Approach.
Guidelines for operation under the roadmap are divided into 3 measures: 1) Measures
to reduce the generation of plastic waste at the source, 2) Measures to reduce the use of
single-use plastic (Single-use Plastic) in the process of consumption, and 3) Measures to
manage the plastic waste after consumption by supporting and encouraging them to be
reused. The roadmap also defines the roles, duties, and responsibilities of relevant
agencies in the implementation of the draft Roadmap in all sectors. It further defines
various mechanisms for the Roadmap mobilization, such as enhancing knowledge
and understanding with relevant agencies, people, and consumers in order to develop
integrated cooperation for the operation and public relations campaign through social
media. There will be studies and target setting on recycled plastics and plastic waste
that cannot be recycled to be disposed of properly.

3.1.3 Municipality Plan
Draft Bangkok Climate Change Master Plan 2021-2030
In 2021, Bangkok Metropolitan Administrator (BMA) and the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) developed the draft Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change
2021-2030. The Master Plan aims to align with the Nationally Determined Contribution
(NDC) in terms of both the policy andthe implementation timeframe. It will significantly
contribute to Bangkok's long term vision to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.
The plan outlines the development of key measures for GHG reduction and climate
change adaptation, including institutional structures, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems.
Bangkok intends to achieve the GHG emission reduction target and the response to climate
change by setting the target and the commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by 19%
compared to the BAU from the base year of 2018 by 2030 and to have the long-term
goal under the vision to continually reduce greenhouse gases toward a “net-zero
emission city” by 2050. The mitigation measures of GHG reduction under this master
plan cover 4 sectors: transport, energy, waste and wastewater, and green urban planning.
The significant sectors for GHG emissions reduction are energy and transport, with
a reduction target of 94% of the total, and the remaining 6% is from the waste
management sector. Green urban planning is the sector that does not directly reduce
GHG emissions but helps to absorb GHGs in the atmosphere.

3.2 Mitigation Measures
3.2.1 Thailand’s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)
3.2.1.1 Domestic NAMA
Thailand proclaimed its Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) to reduce
national GHG emissions from the energy and transport sectors compared to
the Business as Usual (BAU) by stating that Thailand had the potential to reduce
GHG emissions by 7-20 % by 2020. After the target was set, Thailand developed
a system to monitor and assess the amount of GHGs reduction from domestic measures,
especially measures on energy and transport. Thailand has implemented monitoring
and evaluation of GHG reductions as follows:
1) A GHG reduction reporting structure was established according to the Domestic
MRV structure approved by the National Committee on Climate Change Policy, as
illustrated in Chapter 1.
2) The mechanism of the Working Group on GHG Inventory and Mitigation
Measures in the energy sector, as referred to in Chapter 1, “Institutional Arrangement,”
was employed in selecting the appropriate measures/policy for monitoring and evaluating
GHG reduction according to the criteria. Once the measures/policies were obtained, a
method for calculating the GHG reduction was developed, and the Coefficient/Emission
Factor was designated. The MRV process for activity data and calculating GHG reduction
from measures/policy was commenced to prepare a report on greenhouse gas reduction
results.
3) When the Working Group on GHG Inventory and Mitigation Measures approved
the detailed information in the second step, they would send the official information to
the relevant Ministries, i.e., the Climate Change Coordinating Working Group under

93

CHAPTER 3
the Ministry of Energy, to consider the following: appropriate measures/policies for
monitoring and evaluating GHG reductions, GHG reduction calculation methods, MRV
process structure for activity data, and GHG reductions from measures/policy and GHG
reduction reports. When the Ministries approved, they must notify the secretary of the
Working Group on GHG Inventory and Mitigation Measures. In case of disagreement or
amendments, the Ministries could propose and stress the issues that need to be revised.
4) After the relevant Ministries have considered and approved the details under
the third step, the Ministry’s consideration would be submitted to the Subcommittee on
Climate Change Knowledge and Database for further approval.
5) Once the Subcommittee on Climate Change Knowledge and Database
has approved, the GHG reduction results would be presented to and approved by
the National Committee on Climate Change Policy. After approval, GHG reduction results
would be reported in the BUR and NC reports.

For the first phase, achieving the NAMA’s target was the first steppingstone toward
Thailand’s success in reducing GHG emissions in line with the goals of the 20-Year National
Strategy, National Reform Plans, the National Economic and Social Development Plan, and
the country’s Climate Change Master Plan focusing on developing a low-carbon economy.
Since 2015, the Ministry of Energy by the Climate Change Coordinating Working Group
has assigned the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) to be the coordination unit
for implementing the monitoring and evaluation report on GHG reductions from energy
measures. In 2019, the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) started
reporting GHG reduction in the transport sector. The results of the GHG reductions from
2013 - 2019 are summarized as follows:
• In 2013, the GHG reduction was 14.34 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (3.91%) compared to BAU.
• In 2014, the GHG reduction was 37.47 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (10.21%) compared to BAU.
• In 2015, the GHG reduction was 40.14 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (10.94%) compared to BAU.
• In 2016, the GHG reduction was 45.68 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (12.45%) compared to BAU.
• In 2017, the GHG reduction was 51.72 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (14.09%) compared to BAU.
• In 2018, the GHG reduction was 57.84 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (15.76%) compared to BAU.
• In 2019, the GHG reduction was 64.20 MtCO2eq, equivalent to (17.49%) compared to BAU.
(Including transport sector)
In 2020, Thailand reduced GHG emissions to 56.54 MtCO2eq (15.40%) from 10 mitigation
measures in the energy and transport sectors.

Important lessons learned from the implementation of NAMAs which can be beneficial
for the preparation of new mitigation measures are as follows:
1) The formation of the NAMA mitigation roadmap for the energy and transport
sectors in line with the existing plans of government agencies contributed to the success
of respective mitigation measures.
2) The development of a domestic MRV system to track progress toward
NAMA targets involved the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of
Energy, and Ministry of Transport, as well as strong cooperation from other stakeholders
in the public and private sectors.
3) Apart from GHG reduction, other environmental co-benefits could be integrated
into Thailand’s policies and measures, such as biodiversity conservation, air pollution
reduction, and marine litter management, creating multilateral cooperation under other
conventions.

CHAPTER 3
3.2.1.2 International Support
Apart from the national efforts to achieve NAMA’s target, Thailand received international
support in two key projects to reduce GHG emissions:
RAC NAMA
RAC NAMA project, or Thailand Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Nationally Appropriate
Mitigation Action, is commissioned by the NAMA Facility on behalf of the German
Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety and the UK’s
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and implemented by GIZ with
support from Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) and
Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). A milestone
for the IPPU sector, contributing to the NDC achievement with a total emission reduction
of 35,000 tCO2eq. The project implementation can be classified and illustrated as follows:
• Policy: The MRV system has been set for the RAC NAMA project through
the policy and technical recommendations so that Thailand can report the implementation
following the commitment under the Convention and elevate the emission reduction
targets in this sector. The RAC NAMA safety system was demonstrated to relevant
stakeholders to mimic the actual leakage and designate the intensity of leakage from
the system. The result showed the efficiency of the system without any hazards.
• Technology and training: The training center was founded to train chief
mechanics on the safe handling of flammable refrigerants. Nine business operators were
adequately trained to transition the production line and development. The industries
and prototype passed the safety test. The testing operational labs within the Ministry of
Industries were reconditioned to support the testing of air condition using flammable
refrigerants according to new standards of IEC, EN, and TISI 1529-2561
• Financial support: The RAC NAMA fund was established with 8.3 million EUR
or about 300 million THB by EGAT in the name of the Thai government to be the fund
manager. The fund aims to promote the production and utilization of eco-friendly and
energy-efficient refrigeration technology. EGAT has provided financial aid through various
financial instruments for the past two years.
• Supply-side: for the producers to transition their production lines, EGAT provided
1) a short-term loan for one year without interest for 52 million THB and 2) grants for 80
million THB.
• Demand-side: 1) over 10 million THB as a subsidy to induce consumers to
purchase eco-friendly refrigerators and 2) over 146 million THB as subsidy without interest
for marketing measures
• Service sector: 1) 15 million THB of grants to purchase equipment for the 8
training centers and 2) 2.5 million THB grants for reconditioning testing operational labs
at electric and electronics institutes.

Thai Rice NAMA
Thai Rice NAMA is a cooperative project between MOAC and GIZ, funded by NAMA
Facility. This project, implemented from 2018 to 2023, promotes converting traditional
to sustainable rice cultivation or GAP++ by adopting Alternative wetting and drying
(AWD), site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), and crop residue management.
The project targets is 100,000 farmer households in Thailand’s Central plain area (6
provinces). The implementation and progress of the project can be described as
follows:
• GHG emission reduction: It targets GHG reduction of 1.7 million tCO2eq. in
a 5-year period (2018-2023). In 2021, the emission decreased by 160,000 tCO2eq.Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, drought, and floods, the implementation is delayed.
• Technology transfer: Emission reduction technologies were transferred to and
widely adopted by farmers consisting of Alternative wetting and drying (AWD), Laser Land
Leveling, site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), and crop residue management.
• Policy and management: The Sustainable Rice Platform National Chapter was
established as a forum to engage all stakeholders in developing Thai GAP++ (Sustainable
rice standard). The Sustainable Rice Standard has been circulated for public hearing. Now
it is in the process of revision before submission for Agriculture Standard Committee’s
approval and announcement. The standard promotes rice cultivation method that is
internationally recognized as contributing to climate mitigation and adaptation.
• Technical and capacity building: Series of training on sustainable rice
cultivation were provided for 295 officials from the Rice Department (RD) and Department
of Agricultural Extension (DOAE) and 13,220 farmers, the entire rice fields of approximately
63,450 ha. There was a series of training to build capacity for the service providers on
Laser Land Leveling technology. Subsequently, the service providers used this technology
to level the rice fields to 69 farmers in 151.24 ha.
• Financial mechanism: Pre-finance mechanism was established by having the Bank
for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) as a grant manager. By integrating
the project into BAAC’s green finance mechanism, 1,328,444 THB were provided for
farmers to prepare rice fields using Laser Land Leveling technology.
From implementing the Thai Rice NAMA project, the RD, BAAC, and GIZ considered
that sustainable rice cultivation benefited Thailand’s economic, social, and environmental
development and enhanced the farmers’ standard of living. The relevant agencies
continue to scale up and expand the project implementation to other provincial parts of
Thailand. As an Accredited Entity, GIZ held a discussion session with the ONEP and BAAC
to develop a concept note for strengthening Climate Smart Rice Farming and submit
this concept project to Green Climate Fund: GCF in 2021. The approval is to be followed.
Another extension from the Thai Rice NAMA is the project of Strengthening ClimateSmart Rice Value Chains, aiming to improve the capacity of rice farmers and service
providers on climate mitigation and adaption technology. The project targets 250,000
farmer households in 15 provinces with emissions from rice fields of 3.7 million tCO2eq.
The project will be developed through a rice cultivation paradigm shift, rice value chain
generation, and private sector participation.

CHAPTER 3
3.2.2 Preparation for NDC Transition
When NAMA ended in 2020, Thailand has transitioned toward the second phase, i.e.,
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that focuses on reducing GHG emissions in
the energy, transport, IPPU, and waste management sectors which is more challenging
than the first phase. Therefore, it is necessary to have various mechanisms for operations
to achieve the goals. ONEP has prepared the following:
3.2.2.1 Preparation for NDC Tracking System
Thailand has established the MRV system to track progress on climate mitigation measures
under the NDC Roadmap 2021-2030. MRV system plays a significant role in steering
the implementation of mitigation measures to achieve the targets set by responsible
agencies in the following sectors: Energy, Transport, IPPU, and Waste. It also enables
all relevant stakeholders’ engagement, including the public sector, private sector,
academic institutions, international organizations, and citizens, to acknowledge problems
and constraints arising from such implementation. Thus, the mitigation policies, plans, and
measures can be revised, making them appropriate and in line with the current situation.
ONEP, as a national focal point of the Convention, the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of
Industry, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and the private sectors has
prepared to measure, report, and verify the implementation of mitigation measures under
the NDC Roadmap on three sectors: Energy, IPPU, and Waste.
In the Energy sector, the information form and methodology were developed.
The handbook on MRV will be prepared to apply for 1) measures enhancing
energy efficiency from reusing heat (energy production and industrial use), 2) measures
enhancing energy efficiency from electricity used in the manufacturing industry, and
3) measures enhancing energy efficiency from heat production in the manufacturing
industry. In the IPPU sector, the representatives from the Ministry of Industry, Thai Cement
Manufacturers Association, and Thailand Concrete Association have discussed and
prepared the MRV system. As a result, the MRV framework will be applied to
clinker substitution measures in hydraulic cement production. In the Waste sector, ONEP
initiated a working session with TGO and PCD to develop a methodology for GHG
emission reduction, designate the emission factors, test the MRV system, and improve
the MRV handbook for measures on municipal solid waste management and biogas
production from industrial wastewater.
3.2.2.2 Study and analysis of guidelines for reporting GHG reduction and developing
a system to collect and link data from all sectors under the Enhanced Transparency
Framework (ETF) of the Paris Agreement
ONEP has prepared a study and an analysis of activity data reporting patterns and
supporting information in various fields from measures under the national participation
mechanism established in accordance with the Enhanced Transparency Framework under
the framework of the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP) and the resolutions of
the Conference of Parties (COP). This preparation aims to develop a TGEIS system to
support GHG inventory and the MRV system for NDC tracking. ONEP has also analyzed
the monitoring and evaluation guidelines to cover the NDC action plan for 2021–2030.

3.2.2.3 Preparation for an economic and social impact assessment on LT-LEDS
measures implementation
ONEP has prepared a study to assess the economic and social impacts of
the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction measures under the long-term national
strategy by gathering information related to the socio-economic impact assessment, such
as general information, socio-economic status, demand-supply condition (demand-supply),
both current and future forecasts, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, demographics,
employment, and related policies. Subsequently, ONEP has used a model to analyze and
compare the results of overall and sectoral studies of long-term GHG reduction measures
implementation under the case of 1.5 °C and the case where Thailand moves toward
carbon neutrality.

3.2.3 Supporting Measures and Voluntary Actions
Clean Development Mechanism: CDM
The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol,
allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under
the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission-reduction project in
developing countries. Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction
(CER) credits, each equivalent to one ton of CO2, which can be counted toward meeting
Kyoto targets. Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO), as Designated
National Authority of CDM, has issued Letter of Approval to 222 projects. Thailand
has 154 CDM projects registered by the Clean Development Mechanism Executive
Committee (CDM EB), classifying UNFCCC projects into 147 general projects and
7 planned projects (PoA). In addition, Thailand has 70 CDM projects certified for
greenhouse gases (issued CERs) with 15.03 million tCO2eq.

CHAPTER 3
Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM)
The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is a bilateral mechanism initiated by Japan to
help Thailand adopt low-carbon technology for greenhouse gas reduction projects with
financial support from the Japanese government. The JCM mechanism is managed by
the Joint Committee, which consists of committees from Japan and Thailand. Greenhouse
gas reduction projects require measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) to ensure
reliable reduction in greenhouse gases. The Joint Committee endorses the methodology
used to calculate the amount of greenhouse gases that can be reduced. Register and
certify the amount of greenhouse gases that the project reduces, also known as carbon
credits. Certified reductions in greenhouse gases can be used to meet greenhouse gas
reduction targets under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). From 2015-2021, the Ministry of Environment of Japan has funded 38 of
Thailand’s projects to develop JCM Model Projects, expected to be reduced GHG by
204,968 tCO2eq/year.

Low Emission Support Scheme (LESS)
The Low Emission Support Scheme, also known as the LESS project, aims to raise
awareness of greenhouse gas emission reduction and support the operators of greenhouse
gas reduction activities by providing them a letter of recognition (LOR). LOR is issued for
the activities that have already been implemented and achieved GHG reduction, and
the GHG reduction cannot be sold or purchased. The objectives are to honor
the operators, encourage greenhouse gas reduction activities on a small scale, such as
communities, temples, and schools, and encourage support for implementing greenhouse
gas reduction projects. The benefits of LESS implementation include:
• Showing Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSR) through
the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction activities
• Creating opportunities for the communities to receive funding, technology, and
potential development support in conducting greenhouse gas reduction activities
• Contributing to job creation and revenue from activities that reduce greenhouse
gases
• Supporting the development of greenhouse gas reduction technology in
the country
• Restoring and maintaining the ecological balance of natural resources and
the environment
• Raising awareness for organizations, agencies, and communities to contribute to
greenhouse gas reduction and conduct environmentally friendly activities
From 2015-2021, there are 1,041 operators and 7,697 activities with total GHG reduction
of 3,518,444 tCO2eq and total carbon sequestration 186,582,286 tCO2eq.

Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program (T-VER)
Thailand has established guidelines on the trading and use of carbon credits for
domestic and international purposes. Recognizing global awareness of climate
change and GHG emissions reduction, as well as the guidelines under Article 6 of
the Paris Agreement, Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) has
developed an internationally equivalent standard of Thailand Voluntary Emission
Reduction Program or T-VER as an alternative for project developers to use and trade
internationally recognized carbon credits. T-VER mechanism promotes and supports
all sectors to voluntarily participate in GHG emission reduction. The T-VER carbon
credits are developed in compliance with the requirements of the GHG reduction
mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement and the international voluntary GHG
reduction mechanism implemented by non-governmental organizations such as the
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard (GS). The participants can trade
the emission reduction unit or carbon credit, called “T-VER,” under the voluntary carbon
result in carbon sequestration within Thailand’s jurisdiction. The benefits of T-VER include:
• Carbon Credits can be used for CSR purposes and voluntary carbon offsets for
companies.
• Encouraging the development of GHG emission reduction projects with
co-benefits by means of certifying carbon credits
• Promoting Voluntary Carbon Market in Thailand
• Raising perception /awareness of climate change and encouraging public and
private sector involvement
• Preparing all stakeholders for the future new agreement on Global GHG emission
reduction
From 2014-2021, 257 projects have been registered as T-VER projects with the expected
GHG emissions reduction potential of 9,582,052 tCO2eq per year.

Carbon Offsetting Program and Voluntary Carbon Market
In 2013, Thailand launched the Thailand Carbon Offsetting Program (T-COP). Each
participant (i.e., individuals, organizations, products & services, and events) can voluntarily
offset their GHG emissions in this offsetting carbon program. It provides a platform for
a participant to offset its carbon footprint by contributing money to retire the certified
carbon credits, particularly the domestic carbon credits from (T-VER). This has created
a voluntary carbon market in Thailand with a transaction volume of around 286,000
tCO2eq at the average price of carbon credits around 34 THB/tCO 2eq. Thailand’s
carbon market is a small voluntary market with an average growth rate of 8.5% per annum,
with most carbon credit trading within Thailand in the form of negotiations. (Over-theCounter: OTC) the price of carbon credits is between 15-200 THB/ tCO2eq. From 20132021, overall participants are 112 companies with 690,678 tCO2eq carbon credits, 46
products with 3,471 tCO2eq carbon credits, 107 events with 15,523 tCO2eq carbon
credits, and 1,265 individuals with 5,817 tCO2eq carbon credits.

Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF)
Corporate Carbon Footprint for Organization (Corporate Carbon Footprint: CCF) is
a method for displaying the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from corporate
operations. This will lead to the determination of the management approach. Manage to
effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the factory, industrial and national levels.
Currently, TGO has created a project to promote the organization’s carbon footprint in
the industrial sector and local government. CCF shows the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted by corporate activities such as fuel combustion, electricity consumption, waste
management, and transportation. It can be used to drive the organization’s management
of greenhouse gas emission reduction.

CHAPTER 3
Carbon Footprint Products (CFP)
TGO initiated the Carbon Footprint of Products promotion project to raise
consumer awareness and disseminate Carbon Footprint (CFP) labeling information from
the production process through the products in the market. The CFP label attached to
the products shows consumers how much greenhouse gases are emitted throughout
the products’ life cycle from acquiring raw materials, production processes, distribution,
use, and waste management after expiration of use, which helps to make consumers’
decisions. The scheme aims to induce manufacturers to adopt mitigation measures and
reduce GHG production with consumers’ purchase power. Furthermore, this CFP can
be used by business partners through their supply chain; the buyers can request CF
information of purchased raw materials from suppliers to quantify their CFP through their
products’ life cycle. Thus, the final manufacturers can disclose their CFP on products to
express their awareness of global warming and climate change.
This effort can also increase the competitiveness of Thai producers in the global market,
where the concern on the importance of global warming and climate change is continually
increasing. TGO, in collaboration with the National Science and Technology Development
Agency (NSTDA), developed requirements and guidelines for quantifying the Carbon
Footprint of Products. The guidelines aim to disseminate a standardized approach to
Thai producers to quantify their CFP. TGO has developed the CFP certification and
registration scheme for Thai producers in accordance with ISO 14067: 2018 Greenhouse
gases – Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification
and developed a third-party verification system to increase the credibility and reliability
of the Thai CFP scheme to meet the International Standardization. Producers who intend
to quantify their CFP shall comply with the assigned Product Category Rule (PCR) and
the requirements and guidelines for quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Products.

Carbon Footprint Reduction (CFR)
Carbon Footprint Reduction Label (CFR) or Global Warming Reduction Label is a label that
demonstrates a certified Carbon Footprint of Product (CFP) and its emissions reduction
based on the TGO eligible reduction criteria. The CFR evaluation process includes
the quantification and certification of the base year and current year CFP and
the comparison results between the base year and current year certified CFP or against
its product category benchmarking threshold announced by TGO. The product registered
as CFR shall comply with the following requirements: 1) The certified CFP of its current
year compared to the base year certified CFP shall be reduced not less than 2% or
2) The certified CFP of its current year is equal to or less than the product category
benchmarking threshold and not more than its base year certified value. In 2021,
127 products from 28 companies were labeled with an overall emission reduction of
294,055 tCO2.

Low Carbon City
• Municipality and GHG Inventory
The department of local governments and TGO collaborated to encourage local
governments to report greenhouse gas data in local governments and cities to promote
the management of greenhouse gases in local governments to become a carbon
reduction politics and as a database for greenhouse gas reduction activities to become
a carbon reduction city. From 2011-2021, a total of 237 municipalities participated in
the project, and also expanded the city’s carbon footprint in 2014 to guide the reporting
of urban greenhouse gas data as well as for the year 2019, with the cooperation of
94 municipalities, which has been implemented in the city-level greenhouse gas data
reporting guidelines and appropriate greenhouse gas reduction plans in each area.

• Achieving Low Carbon Growth in Cities through Sustainable Urban System
Management in Thailand Project (GEF5) (LCC)
TGO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have joined forces to
develop the project “Achieving Low Carbon Growth in Cities through Sustainable Urban
System Management in Thailand,” with financial support from the World Environment
Fund (Global Environment Fund: GEF) of 3.15 million USD. The project was launched in
2017 and accomplished in July 2021.
The LCC project was designed as a four-year project to promote low-carbon urban
development in mid-sized Thai cities. It pursues the dual aims of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions reductions, economic benefits, and enhancement of the lives of local
people through an improved urban environment. Emphasis is on the waste management,
transport, and electricity end-use sectors. The project cooperates with the four mid-sized
Thai cities of Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiang Mai, Samui, and Khon Kaen.
LCC targets three outcomes for its partner cities: (1) low carbon planning,
(2) demonstration of low carbon city initiatives, and (3) financing of increased
investment in low carbon city initiatives. For each city, the low carbon planning work
features, development of city carbon footprints, and low carbon development strategies
are to be incorporated into mainstream planning. The demo outcome features a package
of demos for each city. Nakhon Ratchasima and Khon Kaen demos cut across all three
sectors: waste management, end-use energy/ distributed solar PV, and transport, while

107

CHAPTER 3
Chiang Mai focuses entirely on transport and Samui on organic waste management.
The financing/ investment outcome was intended to develop financing mechanisms
for low carbon development, but its design also features capacity building and
awareness-raising. Subsequently, TGO has set up a Bureau for Low Carbon Cities and plans
additional city-level outreach, though it aims to address the local level through
cooperation with provinces. TGO also plans to work with the responsible Ministry, MOI,
to develop low-carbon KPIs for the city and provincial staff.

Developing Low Carbon and Circular Economy Model for Industry in Eastern
Economic Corridor (EEC) Area
To accelerate economic growth in the next 20 years, the Thai government has set
a strategy to promote investment, trade, production, and services in the Eastern
Economic Corridor (EEC). The EEC was designated as a sandbox (pilot area) for various
economic, social, and environmental development initiatives. In terms of production,
more than 37% of the total factories in Thailand are located in the EEC area. Thus, this
area possesses a high GHG reduction potential and could be developed as a model for
low-carbon industrial cities. In 2018, TGO initiated “Integrating Climate Actions into
the Eastern Economic Corridor: Toward Low Carbon Industry Project.” The objectives
are 1) to develop
a circular economy and low carbon model for the industry in the EEC area (CE-EEC
model), 2) to provide recommendations on circular economy for low carbon industry in
the EEC area, 3) to conduct a survey on low carbon technologies and encourage
industries to self-assess their low carbon industry readiness, and 4) to develop and integrate
the circular economy database into GHG Mitigation Information Platform developed by
TGO.
During 2019-2020, policy recommendations and action plans during 2021-2030 were
developed to promote the low-carbon industry in the EEC area. Sixty factories from 3
provinces in the EEC area participated and implemented GHG management and
emission reduction activities. Among these factories, 44 factories calculated and reported
an organization’s carbon footprint (CFO), 11 factories reported the carbon footprint of
a product (CFP), and 7 factories developed T-VER projects. GHG Mitigation Information
Platform was established to disseminate the project information, knowledge, and
information relevant to GHG emission reduction, such as low-carbon technologies,
number, and name of factories registered to CFO/CFP/T-VER scheme with TGO. In 2021,
6 industries were adopting the CE-EEC Model with the capacity to reduce GHG
emissions equivalent to 1.69 million tCO2 per year. Sets of data on raw materials, product
parts, by-products, and wastes were collected from 88 industries in the EEC areas. From
the data received from 111 industries, in case technologies are advanced, the capacity
to reduce GHG emissions significantly increases to 11,772.42 tCO2. A low carbon
technologies database surveyed 85 factories, and results reveal the low carbon industry
readiness self-assessment from 75 factories.

CHAPTER 4:

VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION

In accordance with Article 7, paragraph 10 and 11 of the Paris Agreement, this chapter,
Vulnerability and Adaptation of this NC is also Thailand’s first Adaptation Communication.
It is vital for Thailand, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts, to
assess climate risks, impacts, and the country’s vulnerability and set up adaptation plans
in all climate-variable sectors with the objective of becoming climate-resilient.
This chapter begins with a brief description of national circumstances, institutional
arrangements, and legal frameworks for climate change adaptation. It further reveals the
study on Thailand’s climate impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities assessments in 6 significant
sectors: water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural
resources, and human settlement and security. The risk and vulnerability assessments are
based on the top-down approach using climate scenarios generated through the most
updated version of the General Circulation Models (GCMs). After the risks and vulnerabilities
assessment, the chapter illustrates the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which has
a vision that “Thailand is resilient with adaptive capacity to climate change impacts and
move toward sustainable development,” and its priorities and implementation focus on
the followings: increasing water security and reducing losses and damage from
water-related disasters; maintaining productivity and food security amidst climate
change risks and impacts; strengthening the capacity of the tourism sector toward
climate-resilience and sustainable development; establishing effective public health
systems to manage risks and reduce impacts from climate change; ensuring sustainable
management of biodiversity resources to respond to climate change impacts; and
enhancing the capacity of individuals, communities, and cities to adapt to climate change
impacts appropriately according to the local context.
Nevertheless, certain barriers remain for Thailand to overcome in order to have effective
and efficient climate adaptation implementation—limitation of knowledge, lack of
continued financial support, lack of central database, lack of national climate
information center, and lack of access to adaptation technologies. Therefore, Thailand
requires technical, technology, and financial support in establishing a unified data system
and coordination mechanism, monitoring and evaluation system, and financial mechanism
for fund mobilization and utilization.

112

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
4.1 National Circumstances, Institutional Arrangements, and Legal Frameworks
4.1.1 National circumstances
Thailand is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. According to the Global
Climate Risk Index 2021, which is the index that analyzes the extent to which countries
and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events, Thailand was
ranked the 9th most affected country – both in terms of human impacts (fatalities) and direct
economic losses – from weather-related loss events during 2000-2019. Different sectors
and different regions in Thailand are vulnerable to different climate hazards. Thailand's
coastal zone is at greater risk of intensive flooding resulting from sea-level rise and coastal
erosion in several provinces. Around 20 million people are living in these vulnerable areas.
The country’s total coastal length is approximately 3,151 kilometers, around a quarter of
which are experiencing erosion rates between 1-5 meters per year. Bangkok, the capital
city of Thailand, has one of the highest risks in the world for intensive flooding because
of climate change-induced changes in precipitation, sea level rise, and coastal erosion.
In term of sectoral impacts, given that around 47% of land use in Thailand is dedicated
to agriculture and around 30% of the Thai labor force still participate in the agricultural
sector, the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change is a point of concern.
Thailand’s production of crops, livestock and fisheries crucially depend on suitable
climate (IPCC, 2014). In the context of Thailand, as indicated in Thailand’s First Assessment
Report on Climate Change 2011, different crops have varying degrees of exposure to
the effect of climate change. For instance, rice is sensitive to high temperature, drought,
and flood. Livestock is also vulnerable to high temperature and drought as increased
temperature might cause heat stress in some types of livestock, particularly swine.
Fisheries and aquaculture are also vulnerable to high temperature, salinity, and
acidification. Apart from agricultural sector, other sectors are also vulnerable to impacts
of climate change, namely water resource management, public health, tourism, natural
resource management, and human settlement and security.
In addition to the physical impacts of climate change, Thailand is also vulnerable to
changes in socio-economic conditions. Among several major driving forces, the aging
population is one of the issues of concern. A decline in birth rate with a concurrent
increase in life expectancy has contributed toward shaping Thailand’s population
structure into an “aging society.” Thailand is projected to be a “super-aged society”
by 2035. This is projected to put a financial strain on healthcare, long-term care, and
pensions, among other things. Plus, the shrinking labor force will impact Thailand’s
economy, and the aging population is more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

113

CHAPTER 4
4.1.2 Institutional arrangements and legal frameworks
With regard to the institutional arrangements for climate change adaptation, the
Subcommittee on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration is a subcommittee
under the National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC). The roles of the Subcommittee
on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration are to provide comments on policy
integration, strategy, and planning that are linked with climate mitigation and adaptation;
provide suggestions on mechanism and measures, including law regulations and financial
measures; and push forward an integrated budget allocation system on climate change.
The Subcommittee on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration appointed the
Working Group on National Climate Change Adaptation Implementation Integration for
the first time on 11 April 2017 and revised its composition and role to be appropriate and
effective on 25 March 2019. Figure 4-1 shows the institutional arrangement related to
climate change adaptation. The roles of the Working Group on National Climate Change
Adaptation Implementation Integration are to provide suggestions, recommendations,
and supports in the development of the National Adaptation Plan as well as research,
policy, strategies, plans, tools and mechanisms related to the National Adaptation Plan;
support the integration and mainstreaming of National Adaptation Plan into sectoral and
regional plans; drive the implementation of the National Adaptation Plan as well as the
related policies, strategies and plans; monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures
under the National Adaptation Plan; and inviting representatives of public and
private organizations to share information to the National Working Group on Integration
of Adaptation Implementation.

The Secretary General of ONEP is serving as a Chairman of the Working Group on National
Climate Change Adaptation Implementation Integration. This Working Group comprises
23-line ministries, representatives from academia and the private sector, and 7 national
experts related to climate change adaptation. The Climate Change Management
and Coordination Division, ONEP serves as secretary of the National Working Group
on Integration of Adaptation Implementation.
When it comes to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) formulation process, Figure 4-2
shows that once the second draft of NAP was formulated, it first went through the review
and consideration by the Working Group on National Climate Change Adaptation
Implementation Integration, and subsequently being reviewed and considered by the
Subcommittee on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration and the National
Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) before being submitted to the Cabinet for final
approval. Once the Cabinet approved the NAP, it was then submitted to the UNFCCC.

CHAPTER 4
With regard to the legal framework, Thailand’s Climate Change Bill was formulated
by ONEP. The Climate Change Bill aims to increase the efficiency of climate
actions in Thailand, put in place long-term adaptation to climate change, and promote
sustainable development. The Climate Change Bill stipulates that there should be climate
projection and the risk and vulnerability assessments. In addition, the national central
climate change database should be developed and accessible to the public so that
the data can be used to assess the risks and impacts of climate change. The National
Adaptation Plan will provide guidelines and measures to support adaptation to climate
change and reduce the risks of climate change.

4.2 Impacts, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
4.2.1 Past and current climate
Chapter 1 presents the trend in past climate – annual mean maximum temperature (Figure
1-7), annual mean minimum temperature (Figure 1-8), annual mean temperature (Figure
1-9), and annual mean rainfall (Figure 1-10) – for Thailand during 1950-2021. Figures 1-7
and 1-8, clearly illustrate that both annual mean maximum and minimum temperature in
Thailand are on an upward trend. Considering the annual mean temperature shown in
Figure 1-9, it was found that between 1981-1990, temperatures increased by 0.33°C, while
the periods of 1991-2000 and 2001-2010 recorded annual mean temperature increases
of 0.16°C and 0.145°C per decade, respectively. The average temperature in Thailand
from 2011 to 2021 increased by an average of 0.09°C per year.
Considering the past trend in annual mean rainfall for Thailand, according to Figure
1-10, precipitation in Thailand has high variability. Based on the Thai Meteorological
Department's climate changes report, it was found that the variation of precipitation and
the number of rainy days has oscillated over time. This widening range in rainfall pattern
and amount can present a host of problems in many sectors, especially agriculture and
water management.
4.2.2 Projected Climate Trends and Hazards
With regard to future changes in temperature, according to the study by ONEP and
RU-CORE (2021), three scenarios were considered, i.e., 1°C, 1.5°C, and 2°C rise in
temperature relative to the 1970-2005 period. The results shown in Figure 4-3 are based
on 3 General Circulation Models, namely MPI-ESM-MR, EC-Earth, and HadGEM2-ES,
and Ensembled or the group of climate models.

In terms of future projection of extreme rainfall, Figure 4-4 shows the maximum 1-day
precipitation (Rx1day) under RCP4.5, under 3 GCMs, namely EC-Earth, HadGEM2-ES,
and MPI-ESM-MR and 3 time horizons: near future (2016-2035), intermediate future (20462065), and far future (2081-2099). Figures 4-4 shows that the maximum 1-day precipitation
is projected to increase. This reflects the tendency of flash flood from heavy precipitation.

Figure 4-5, the total annual precipitation is projected to decrease, which reflects the signal
of drought under the future climate change. Under the future climate change scenarios,
the northeastern and southern regions tend to have higher drought impacts than other
regions of Thailand (Jerasorn Santisirisomboon, Jaruthat Santisirisomboon, Waranyu

CHAPTER 4
4.2.3 Sectoral Impacts of Climate Change
Climate change has wide-ranging impacts on Thailand’s economy, ecosystems,
economic sectors as well as health and livelihoods, but the impacts are not uniform.
Different sectors and regions in Thailand are affected differently by climate change.
The impact chain analysis is used to understand the impacts of climate change on each
sector. Impact chain is a tool, which helps in understanding, systemizing, and prioritizing
factors that drive risk and vulnerability in each sector, and it takes a form of a cause-effect
relationship. This tool provides a representation of how potential climate change risks
can affect a system via direct and indirect impacts and leads to the prioritization of the
most relevant climate change risks for deeper analysis and for identifying sector-specific
adaptation measures (Eucker and Morales, 2016). The analysis results of climate change
sectoral impacts using impact chain analysis are as follows:
4.2.3.1 Water management sector
For the water management sector, the main climate hazards include extreme
temperature, drought, coastal erosion, variation in rainy season, floods, and landslide
(Figure 4-6). Both resources – upstream watershed, downstream river basin, and
groundwater – and system and infrastructure are exposed to these hazards. Impacts in
the water management sector include changes in water availability, disruption of water
supply, agricultural harvest failure, disruption of water logistic, damage to infrastructure,
as well as conflicts on water use among sectors.

4.2.3.2 Agriculture and food security sectors
The main climate hazards in the agriculture and food security sectors include cold spells,
extreme temperature, drought, coastal erosion, variation in rainy season and floods, and
excessive rainfall (Figure 4-7). Different types of agricultural products – fisheries, livestock,
and crops – are unequally and non-uniformly exposed. In addition, natural resources
used in agriculture, particularly soil and water, are also affected by climate change.
Examples of impacts of climate change on capture fisheries and aquaculture in Thailand
include changes in fish species population as well as changes in quality and quantity of
fisheries as health, growth, breeding, and habitat are interrupted. For livestock, there
might be interruptions in the health, growth, and breeding of livestock, which in turn affect
the quality and quantity of livestock. Climate change might affect crop production during
the growing phases as cause post-harvest loss. Climate change might also indirectly
impact agricultural production by decreasing soil fertility and water availability.

4.2.3.3 Tourism sector
The main climate hazards in the tourism sector include drought, storm surge/
coastal flooding, variation in rainy season, flooding/flash floods, and landslides
(Figure 4-8). These climate hazards adversely affect outdoor tourism activities, tourism
destinations – both man-made attractions and natural attractions – and public and private
services, such as traffic infrastructure, tourism facilities, water and energy supply, and waste
management. Examples of impacts of climate change on tourism activities and
destinations include disruptions of outdoor tourism activities, loss of cultural tourist
attractions and amenities, loss of natural characteristics and attractiveness, and reduced
diversity of natural resources. Examples of impacts of climate change on public and
private services include interruption of the transport system, injuries and loss of life,
disruption of public services, and conflicts with local communities over resource uses.

4.2.3.4 Public health sector
The main climate hazards in the public health sector include cold spells, extreme
temperatures, drought, coastal erosion, storm surge/coastal flooding, flooding/flash flood,
and landslides (Figure 4-9). In terms of exposure, climate change affects health through
diverse channels, including air quality, physical outdoor activity, nutrition quality and
quantity, water quality and quantity, sanitation facilities in households and communities,
health facilities and medical services, as well as physical security and integrity. Deteriorated
air quality leads to respiratory diseases, diseases, loss of life, heat stress, and cardiovascular
disease. Change in vector ecology because of climate change can lead to emerging and
re-emerging diseases. Interrupted nutrition and water qualities and quantities can lead
to malnutrition and increased spread of germs. In addition, the destroyed or damaged
health facilities due to climate change can lead to disruption in medical services. Storm
surge, flooding/flash flood, and landslides may cause injuries or loss of life.

4.2.3.5 Natural resource management sector
The main climate hazards in the natural resource management sector include extreme
temperature, drought, coastal erosion, storm surge/coastal flooding, variation in rainy
season, landslides, floods, and excessive rainfall (Figure 4-10). The natural resources that
are exposed to these climate hazards can be largely grouped into marine and coastal
ecosystems, wetlands, and terrestrial ecosystems.
For marine and coastal ecosystems, examples of impacts include loss of coastal and
marine species and ecosystems, decreased tourism demand, reduced fisheries
productivity, changing livelihood of coastal population, and loss of natural nursery for
species. For wetlands, examples of impacts include biodiversity loss, increased extinction
of species, and food insecurity. For terrestrial ecosystems, examples of impacts include
changing and shifting of habitat and interconnections between ecosystems and
disturbing its functions and emerging diseases and their transmission from wildlife to
livestock and humans.

4.2.3.6 Human settlement and security sectors
The main climate hazards in the human settlement and security sector include
cold spells, extreme heat, drought, coastal erosion, storm surge/coastal flooding,
flooding, flash floods, and landslides (Figure 4-11). Considering the exposure in the human
settlement and security sectors, population, urban system and services as well
as land use characteristics, spatial planning and infrastructure are exposed to
the impacts of climate change. Examples of climate change impacts on population include
injuries, loss of life and diseases. For the impacts of climate change on urban system and
services, climate change can cause interruption of water supply for agriculture, industry
and residential area as well as disruption of public services. For the impacts on land use
characteristics, spatial planning and infrastructure, examples include damages and
destruction of infrastructure and loss of public and private property.

CHAPTER 4
4.2.4 Methodology for Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
The risk and vulnerability assessments under this Fourth National Communication are
based on the top-down approach, which is based on climate scenarios generated through
the most updated version of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) available (Figure
4-12). The three GCM models used in this assessment include MPI-ESM-MR, EC-Earth, and
HadGEM2-ES, and these three models are combined into “Ensembled.” Robust climate
change scenarios are at the heart of the successful V&A assessment. To ensure that there
are sufficient details for country-level V&A assessment, it is important that the GCMs are
downscaled to a finer resolution for use at a national level. Dynamical downscaling of 3
models provided by the SEACLID/CORDEX SEA Phase II project: MPI-ESM-MR model,
EC-Earth model, and HadGEM2-ES model were used, and 2 Representative Concentration
Pathways (RCPs) were considered, i.e., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The future climate projections
are under 4 timeframes 1970-2005, 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099.

the Convention”

Vulnerability is separated into 2 categories, physical/biophysical vulnerability and
inherent/social vulnerability. The former is the potential damage to a system caused by
a specific event involving a physical hazard or disaster or climate catastrophe, whereas
the latter is the state of the system that exists prior to exposure to danger or danger, which
are indices indicating the internal workings of the system and explains the structures that
make the society or ecosystem sensitive to external harm or damage. Their relationship
can be summarized as follows:

132

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

Biophysical vulnerability = f (hazard X social vulnerability)
Biophysical vulnerability shares many characteristics with the framework for risk, which is
the likelihood of danger or disaster and its consequences. Risks are calculated as follows:
Risk = biophysical vulnerability = probability of hazards X (loss/consequences)
The risk maps developed by ONEP and RU-CORE are based on the 2007 IPCC’s
definition of vulnerability: “Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to
and unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability
and extremes.” By this definition, vulnerabilities are a function of exposure, sensitivity,
and adaptive capacity. Figure 4-13 shows the framework used to develop risk maps. It
was mentioned earlier that the impacts and risks of climate change are uneven and
non-homogeneous across sectors. These risk maps show that impacts and risks of climate
change are also uneven and non-homogeneous across regions and time horizons. As will
be shown later, different provinces and regions in Thailand are impacted differently by
the risks of flooding, drought, and heat, and the impacts vary over time.
Risks are influenced by climate drivers and non-climate drivers. These two factors are
calculated and weighed on their direct and indirect risks, and transformed into visual
risk maps. The umbrellas under which risks are presented are heat, flooding, drought,
and all three risks combined. Direct and indirect risks were calculated for 6 sectors:
water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resource
management, and human settlement.

CHAPTER 4

For all the 6 sectors, 3 types of climate hazards are considered: high temperature (heat),
drought, and flooding. Several climate indices are used in the calculation of risk indices.
Examples of these climate indices are mean maximum temperature, annual contribution
from wet days, maximum 1-day precipitation, and consecutive dry days. The number and
nature of non-climate drivers vary across sectors, such as water demand and land area for
the agricultural sector and number of tourists and number of tourism sites for the tourism
sector. The numbers of non-climate indices in each sector are summarized in Table 4-1.

Each index was scaled to a province-level and then normalized to a value between 0-1
using the maximum-minimum normalization technique. All indices were added together
using an additive model and normalized again to a value between 0-1. Both the climate
and non-climate risks were then added together to create the risk index.
Process of risk map development started by adjusting the climate indices from
the 25 x 25km grid to show province-level averages. Next, the heat, drought, and flood
hazard indices were calculated. The heat, drought, and flooding hazard indices were used
to calculate the combined hazard index. The non-climate indices were developed for
each province. Next, non-climate indices were calculated regarding their relationship to
each hazard type, namely heat, flooding, and drought. Lastly, combined risk indices are
calculated, which are a product of the heat, flooding, and drought risk indices. All
the risk maps for the 6 sectors and for 3 hazard types are presented in the Appendix.
For each sector, two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are considered, i.e.,
the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Four time horizons are considered, namely 1970-2005,
2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. The risk maps under three GCM models – MPI-ESMMR , EC-Earth, and HadGEM2-ES – and “Ensembled” model are shown. In each sector,
the risk maps for heat, flooding, and drought are presented as well as the overall risk map.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

4.2.5 Climate change risks by sector
4.2.5.1 Water management sector
Water management is linked to climate change in many aspects. As mentioned
earlier, climate change leads to changes in water availability, disruption of water supply,
agricultural harvest failure, disruption of water logistic, damage to infrastructure, as well
as conflicts on water use among sectors. Nevertheless, the impacts of climate change
in the water management sector are non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in
Thailand as shown in the following risk maps.
In assessing the risks of climate change in the water management sector, 7 categories
of non-climate factors were considered: access to water resources, population, physical
characteristics, areas at high risk of water-related disasters, socio-economic conditions,
agricultural land conditions, and infrastructure. A total of 40 non-climate variables were
used, divided into 11 variables related to heat, 20 related to flooding, and 28 related
to drought. These variables are in accordance with the “Climate Risk Assessment for
Ecosystem-based Adaptation: A guidebook for planners and practitioners” as well as
expert opinions.
Figures A-1 in the Appendix shows the heat risk maps for the water management sector
based on the Ensembled model under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and under 4 timeframes,
i.e., 1970-2005, 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. Central provinces, especially
Bangkok and surrounding areas, and provinces in the Northeastern region, particularly
Nakhon Ratchasima and Ubon Ratchathani, are at higher risk of heat than the rest of
the country under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways. Figure A-2 shows the flood risk map
in the water management sector. Provinces at high risk of flooding under both RCP4.5
and RCP8.5 are scattered in the Central, Northeastern, Northern and Southern parts of
Thailand, especially Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Bangkok, and Chiang
Mai. For the drought risk map in the water management sector, Figure A-3 shows that
the provinces at the highest risk of drought in the water management sector are Nakhon
Ratchasima, Bangkok, and Khon Kaen. Generally, the northeastern region is at the highest
risk of drought in water management sector. Figure A-4 presents the overall risk map for
the water management sector. According to the overall risk maps, under both RCP4.5
and RCP8.5, the top 5 provinces at the highest risk are Nakhon Ratchasima, Bangkok,
Ubon Ratchathani, Khon Kaen, and Nakhon Sawan. Most of these high-risk provinces,
except Bangkok, are in the Northeastern regions, showing that the Northeastern region
is relatively at higher risk in the water management sector thanthe rest of the country.
4.2.5.2 Agriculture and food security sectors
The agricultural sector faces many challenges, such as unstable commodity prices and
adverse impacts of climate change. Agriculture is closely linked to climate change: on
the one hand, agricultural sector emits greenhouse gases, and at the same time,
agricultural production is affected by heat, floods, droughts, sea level rise, and other
climate-related hazards. As mentioned earlier, fisheries and aquaculture, crops, and
livestock are affected differently by climate change. Examples of impacts of climate

135

CHAPTER 4
change on capture fisheries and aquaculture include changes in fish species population
as well as changes in the quality and quantity of fisheries. For livestock, the quality and
quantity of livestock are affected by climate change. Climate change might affect crop
production during the growing phases and cause post- harvest loss. Table 4-2 summarizes
the risk factors and the impacts of climate change on crops, livestock, and aquaculture.
However, impacts of climate change in the agriculture and food security sectors are
non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in Thailand, as shown in the following
risk maps.

For the agricultural sector, 19 non-climate factors were considered in the assessment,
such as number of registered farmers, farmland size, areas prone to repeated drought
and flooding, level of damages from flooding and drought. 5 indices are associated with
heat hazard, 10 indices with flooding, and 16 with drought.
Figure A-5 in the Appendix shows the heat risk index map for the agricultural sector under
the Ensembled model, RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways and 4 timeframes, i.e., 1970-2005,
2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. As shown in the figure, the top seven provinces
most at risk of heat in the agricultural sector are in the Northeastern region of Thailand,
namely Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, Buriram, Khon Kaen, Si Sa Ket, Surin, and
Roi Et. Figure A-6 shows the flood risk index map for the agricultural sector. As shown in
the figure, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, and Nakhon Sawan are among the provinces
136

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
with the highest flood risk. The provinces at the fourth and the fifth highest flood risk
are Ubon Ratchathani and Nakhon Sri Thammarat, which are in the Northeastern and
Southern parts of Thailand, respectively. For the drought risk maps, Figure A-7 shows
that four out of 5 provinces at the highest risk of drought in the agricultural sector are
in the Northeastern region, namely Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, Khon Kaen,
and Buriram, while Nakhon Sawan is in the Central region. The overall risk maps for
the agriculture and food security sectors are presented in Figure A-8. According to Figure
A-8, the provinces at the highest risk in the agricultural sector are Nakhon Ratchasima,
Ubon Ratchathani, Khon Kaen, and Buriram, which are in the Northeastern region of
Thailand.
4.2.5.3 Tourism sector
Tourism sector has close connections to the environment and climate; thus, climate
change affects tourism sector in various ways, both directly and indirectly. Since
climate is one of the factors determining the suitability of locations for tourist activities
and the driver for seasonality in tourism demand, climate change can lead to changes in
the length and quality of climate-dependent tourist attractions. Climate change can
lead to disruptions of outdoor tourism activities, loss of cultural tourist attractions and
amenities, loss of natural characteristics and attractiveness, and reduced diversity of
natural resources. Increases in the frequency or magnitude of extreme weather can
also affect the tourism industry through increased infrastructure damage, additional
emergency preparedness requirements, higher operating expenses, and business
interruptions. Examples of impacts of climate change on public and private services
include interruption of transport system, injuries and loss of life, disruption of public
services, and conflicts with local communities over resource uses. Nevertheless, impacts
of climate change in the tourism sector are non-homogeneous across regions and
provinces in Thailand as shown in the following risk maps.
In Thailand’s context, the important hazards are heat, flooding, and drought, with
each tourist activity and tourist attraction facing different levels of risk. The key
categories of non-climate drivers include number of tourists, tourist attractions by type,
area characteristics, and economic impacts. However, each of the 3 climate hazards
comprises of different indices.
Figure A-9 in the Appendix shows the heat risk maps for the tourism sector based on
the Ensembled model under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and under 4 timeframes, i.e., 1970-2005,
2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. As shown in the figure, the top 3 provinces at
the highest risk of heat in the tourism sector are Trat, Bangkok, and Phuket. For the flood
risk maps, according to Figure A-10, the top 3 provinces at the highest risk of flooding
in the tourism sector are Surat Thani, Chiang Mai, and Trat. For the risk of drought in
the tourism sector, Figure A-11 shows the drought risk maps for the tourism sector. As
shown in Figure A-11, the top 3 provinces at the highest risk of drought in the tourism
sector are Nakhon Ratchasima, Bangkok, and Khon Kaen. In terms of overall risk in
the tourism sector, Figure A-12 shows the overall risk index map for the tourism sector.
According to Figure A-12, the provinces at the highest risk in the tourism sector are
Bangkok, Surat Thani, and Trat under RCP4.5, and Bangkok, Surat Thani, and Phuket
under RCP8.5.
137

CHAPTER 4
4.2.5.4 Public health sector
Climate change affects human health and well-being both directly and indirectly. As
mentioned earlier, the impacts of climate change on human health are as follows.
Climate change affects health through changes in air quality, impacts on nutrition
quality and quantity, water quality and quantity, sanitation facilities in households and
communities, health facilities and medical services, as well as physical security and integrity.
Examples of climate change impacts on health include respiratory diseases, heat stress,
cardiovascular disease, emerging and re-emerging diseases, malnutrition and increased
spread of germs, disruption in medical services, injuries, or loss of life. However, impacts
of climate change in the public health sector are non-homogeneous across regions and
provinces in Thailand as shown in the following risk maps. Four categories of non-climate
indices considered in the public health sector are population demographic, health status,
culture and quality of life, and sufficiency and accessibility to resources.
Figure A-13 in the Appendix shows the heat risk maps for the public health sector
based on the Ensembled model under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and under 4 timeframes, i.e.,
1970-2005, 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. As shown in Figure A-13, the top 5
provinces at the highest risk of heat are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani.
Buriram and Khon Kaen; thus, four out of five provinces at the highest risk of heat in the
public health sector are in the Northeastern region of Thailand. For flood risk maps in
the public health sector, Figure A-14 shows that the top 5 provinces at the highest risk
of flood in the public health sector are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani,
Nakhon Sawan and Chiang Mai.
Figure A-15 shows the drought risk maps for the public health sector. According to
Figure A-15, the top 5 provinces at the highest risk of drought in the public health sector
are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, Khon Kaen and Buriram, which are
from the Northeastern region of Thailand, except Bangkok. For the overall risk maps in
the public health sector, Figure A-16 shows that the top 5 provinces at the highest risk
in the public health sector are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, Khon
Kaen and Buriram, which are mostly from the Northeastern region of Thailand.
4.2.5.5 Natural resource management sector
Thailand has a rich abundance of natural resources, many of which are threatened by
climate change. Effects such as temperature fluctuations, changes in precipitation, and
sea level rise affect both terrestrial, wetland as well as marine and coastal ecosystems.
Climate change affects the terrestrial ecosystems by threatening forests and wetlands.
Heat and drought threaten both forests and wetlands, causing loss of settlements,
species especially endemic species, and biodiversity. Mangrove forests, beaches,
sea grass, and corals, which are parts of the marine and coastal ecosystems, are also
threatened by the effects of climate change. For marine and coastal ecosystems,
examples of impacts include loss of coastal and marine species and ecosystems,
decreased tourism demand, reduced fisheries productivity, changing livelihood of
coastal population, and loss of natural nursery for species. For terrestrial ecosystems,
examples of impacts include changing and shifting of habitat and interconnections between
ecosystems and disturbing its functions and emerging diseases and their transmission
from wildlife to livestock and humans. Nevertheless, impacts of climate change in the
138

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
natural resource management sector are non-homogeneous across regions and provinces
in Thailand as shown in the following risk maps.
In the natural resource management sector, 8 non-climate factors are used in
the assessment, which can be divided into 2 factors for heat, 3 factors for flood and
3 factors for drought. Figure A-17 in the Appendix shows the heat risk maps for
the natural resource management sector based on the Ensembled model under RCP4.5
and RCP8.5 and under 4 timeframes, i.e., 1970-2005, 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and
2081-2099. As shown in the figure, the top five provinces at the highest risk of heat in
the natural resource management sector are Ubon Ratchathani, Chiang Mai, Tak,
Lampang, and Kanjanaburi. For the flood risk maps in the natural resource management
sector, as shown in Figure A-18, the top 3 provinces at the highest risk of flood in
the natural resource management sector are Chiang Mai, Tak and Mae Hong Son.
Figure A-19 shows the drought risk maps for the natural resource management sector.
As shown in the figure, under the RCP4.5, the top three provinces at the highest risk of
drought are Ubon Ratchathani, Nakhon Ratchasima and Udon Thani, while under the
RCP8.5, the top three provinces at the highest risk of drought are Ubon Ratchathani,
Nakhon Ratchasima and Chiang Mai. For the overall risk map in the natural resource
management sector, Figure A-20 shows the overall risk maps for the natural resource
management sector. According to Figure A-20, the top 3 provinces at the highest risk
of flood in the natural resource management sector are Chiang Mai, Ubon Ratchathani
and Tak. The fourth and the fifth places under RCP4.5 go to Lampang and Kanjanaburi,
respectively. While the fourth and the fifth places under RCP8.5 go to Kanjanaburi and
Lampang, respectively.
4.2.5.6 Human settlement and security sectors
According to Noor and Fatima (2011), climate change and human settlement are
linked through several dimensions, such as health, water sources, city infrastructure. As
mentioned earlier, some examples of climate change impacts on human settlement
include injuries, loss of life, diseases, interruption of water supply, disruption of
public services, damages and destruction of infrastructure and loss of public and private
property. Yet, these impacts of climate change on human settlement are
non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in Thailand as reflected through
the following risk maps. There are 2 types of risk factors in the development of risk maps
for human settlement sector: climate risk, such as heat, flooding and drought, and nonclimate risk such as urban sprawl and population density.
Figure A-21 in the Appendix shows the heat risk map for the human settlement and
security sector based on the Ensembled model under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and under
4 timeframes, i.e., 1970-2005, 2016-2035, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099. According to
Figure A-21, the top 5 provinces at highest risk of heat are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima,
Samut Prakan, Buriram and Chonburi, which are largely in the Northeastern and Central
regions. Figure A-22 shows the flood risk map for the human settlement and security
sector. According to Figure A-22, under RCP4.5, the top 5 provinces at highest risk of flood
are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sri Thammarat and Chiang Rai.
However, under RCP8.5, the top 5 provinces at highest risk of flood are Bangkok, Nakhon
Ratchasima, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Chiang Mai and Samut Prakan. For the drought risk
139

CHAPTER 4
maps for the human settlement and security sectors, according to Figure A-23, the top
3 provinces at the highest risk of drought in the human settlement and security sector
are Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima and Khon Kaen. The fourth and the fifth places under
RCP4.5 go to Samut Prakan and Ubon Ratchathani, respectively, while under RCP8.5,
the fourth and the fifth places go to Roi Et and Samut Prakan, respectively. For the overall
risk map for the human settlement and security sector, as shown in Figure A-24, the top
4 provinces at the highest overall risk in the human settlement and security sector are
Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Samut Prakan and Khon Kaen both under RCP4.5 and
RCP8.5. However, the fifth rank under RCP4.5 goes to Ubon Ratchathani, while the fifth
rank under RCP8.5 goes to Ayutthaya.

4.3 Implementation of Adaptation Actions and Plans
4.3.1 Water management sector
In the past, most water resource management strategies implemented in Thailand have
been concentrated on the structural measures, as well as finding new water reserves and
community-based water management.
4.3.1.1 Structural adaptation measures
1. Designating areas as flood detention
Certain areas of the country are designated as flood detention, such as Bang
Rakam District in Phitsanulok province or Bang Ban District in Ayutthaya province. In
Thailand, flood detention areas are conceived as agricultural lands which are intentionally
inundated for a short period of time to protect downstream areas from flooding. By storing
water in this flood detention areas, flood movement is slowed. Farmers in the basin areas
are instructed to shift their crop calendars accordingly and receive some compensation
from the Royal Irrigation Department, either in cash or in kind. For in-kind compensation,
farmers who shifted their crop calendar are ensured to have water for their cultivation.
However, there are currently no laws that determine the level of in-cash compensation.
2. Water diversion tunnels
These tunnels connect different drainage basins to drain water from one to
another to collect and reserve them. Examples include the Prasae-Khlong Yai project and
the Khlong Yai-Dok Krai-Nong Pla Lai project in the Eastern part of Thailand. Water from
the Prasae River that is supposed to end up flowing into the sea is diverted and stored
in the Nong Pla Lai Reservoir.
3. Solving saltwater intrusion
The Khlong Lat Pho Floodgate Project and Bang Pakong Dam are examples of
structural measures that help to prevent flood and push saltwater out of the waterways
and nearby irrigation systems. However, the latter led to coastal erosion and so was
unsuccessful.

4.3.1.2 Non-structural adaptation measures
1. Community water management
The Hydro-Informatics Institute (Public Organization) and the local communities
jointly drafted water management plans with the goal of creating water reserves for use
during the dry season. This enables the community to have income during the dry season,
such as by planting crops with low water requirement, and strengthens the community
by creating a water management network. At present, there are over a thousand such
networks, including notable ones such as the Baan Lim Thong in Buriram province and
Baan Sala Din in Pathum Thani province.
2. Establishment of an early warning system
The Thai Meteorological Department and the Royal Irrigation Department work
together to develop a database, combine data from the National Hydroinformatics Data
Center, and develop models for forecasting daily and seasonal rain. However, there needs
to be further development for higher spatial resolution, as currently estimates can only
be made at the provincial level rather than the district level.
4.3.2 Agriculture and food security sectors
Climate change and climate variability have direct impacts on agricultural production.
From drought and flooding to saltwater intrusion, which affects increasingly large areas,
the impacts on the Thai agricultural sector are worsening; therefore, it is very crucial
that the agricultural sector in Thailand adapt to climate change. Adaptation measures in
the agricultural sector are categorized into crops, livestock, and fisheries.
Crops
1. Improving crop varieties that are resistant to pest or drought-tolerant crops
to increase yield and reduce costs of production. Relevant governmental agencies have
been developing and testing these new crop varieties to ensure that they can be grown
in different environment and growing contexts, as well as promoting marketing for those
crops. This includes using crop models, which simulate different areas’ circumstances
such as soil quality and type, temperature, and water quality.
2. Plantation management such as adjusting fertilizer and pesticide use, using
larger-scale farming to reduce costs, and changing crop calendar. For example, in
the Bang Rakam District in Phitsanulok province, farmers will strategically shift their crop
calendar by planting rice early to avoid the flooding season.
3. Development of biotechnologies for farmers
4. Improving infrastructure for farmers especially regarding water supply, such
as improving irrigation systems to cover a larger area and digging wells.

141

CHAPTER 4
Livestock
1. Closed-system farming for livestock such as cows and buffaloes to improve
management of pastures, feeding, and manure, as well as to prevent this livestock from
exposing to high temperature
2. Development of heat-resistant livestock
Fisheries
1. Shifting the method of fish rearing from rivers and canals to cages or closed
systems. This enables better water management and testing.
2. Management of physical environment and water quality that affect coastal
fishing
For the agriculture and food security sector, the highlighted adaptation measure is under
the Thai Rice NAMA project. Summary of the good practices and lessons learned from
this is contained in Box 1.
Box 1: Good Practice for Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture and Food
Security Sector
In the agricultural sector, one adaptation measure to be highlighted as good practice
is under the Thai Rice NAMA project. In irrigated rice production, flooding of paddy
fields leads to significant emissions of methane, which has a global warming potential
(GWP) 28 times higher than carbon dioxide according to IPCC Fifth Assessment
Report (AR5), and involves excessive use of water. The implementation strategies
under the Thai Rice NAMA project involves 4 main technologies, i.e., laser land
leveling, alternate wetting and drying (AWD), site-specific nutrient management,
straw & stubble management) and integrated pest management. The AWD is a
water controlling technique originally developed to save irrigation water use in
paddy field (Bouman and Tuong 2001). This technique controls surface water level
not to fall below a soil depth of 15 cm. Water consumption and methane emission
were reported to be effectively reduced (e.g., LaHue et al. 2016). As water shortage
especially in the dry season is common in Thailand, available water for rice field
irrigation is becoming limited. In addition, extreme climatic events, such as drought
and shift in rainfall distribution pattern, have been widespread in recent decades
and imposed a significant threat to water resources management, especially for rice
cultivation in the future (IPCC 2012; Thailand Research Fund (TRF) 2016). Therefore,
the AWD technique helps in mitigating for GHG emissions and increasing water
use efficiency in rice cultivation.

142

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
4.3.3 Tourism sector
Several climate change adaptation measures in the tourism sector have been proposed,
namely shifting from natural and climate-dependent tourist attractions and activities to
man- made attractions or tourism activities that do not rely on suitable climate, such
as gastronomic tourism, cultural tourism, etc., development of early warning system,
development of climate-resilient infrastructure around the tourism sites, etc.
The climate change adaptation measures in the tourism sector can in fact take various
forms, ranging from technical adaptation to research or managerial adaptation. Technical
adaptation puts emphasis on using technology to adapt to climate change, such as early
warning systems, weather forecasts, storm-resistant buildings, and rainwater recycling
systems. Examples of managerial adaptation measures are water conservation, closing
tourism sites at certain times of the year, and using weather forecasts to plan for different
tourist activities. For educational measures, examples include educating tourists and
tourism businesses on how to adapt to and reduce the impacts of climate change, such as
training hotel staff and tourists about how to save water. For research-based adaptation
measures, examples in Thailand include tracking coral bleaching and seawater quality.
For adaptation measures that emphasize behavioral changes, in the case of Koh Mak
Island in Trat province, tourists and tourism businesses are encouraged to change their
behavior by conserving water.
At present, several relevant government agencies in Thailand are implementing
climate change adaptation in tourism sector. For examples, the Ministry of Tourism and
Sports is supporting the transition toward man-made tourist attractions. The Fine Arts
Department has projects that rehabilitate the historical tourist attractions from
natural disasters, especially flood. However, looking into the future, potential adaptation
measures would be promotion of community-based and creative tourism using local
history, cultures, and uniqueness of the tourist destination to draw visitors and add
value to the location. As opposed to mass tourism, visitors can have a more personal
experience and gain a deeper understanding of the place they are visiting. It also lessens
the pressure on natural resources.
4.3.4 Public health sector
Adaptations to climate change in the public health sector consist of 2 levels,
namely individual level, and system level. Climate change adaptation at the individual
level refers to situation in which people are given knowledge on how to protect
themselves from climate-related hazards, while adaptation at the systems level, includes
developing databases, studying the relationship between climate change and area-specific
vulnerabilities, warning systems, and surveillance. Thailand has developed and used
various technologies in the public health sector to adapt to climate change. Examples are
presented in Table 4-3. For the public health sector, the highlighted adaptation measure
is heat warning system as shown in Box 2.

143

CHAPTER 4

Table 4-3: Adaptation technologies in the public health sector
Technology

144

Details

1. A simple, community-level extreme
weather alert tool

An easy to use, affordable tool that can measure temperature, relative
humidity, heat, and health impact level that shows results in real time
and records data continuously.

2. Heat and smog early warning system in
the upper north area

A system that uses information from 112 measuring stations in 9 provinces
in the upper Northern region of Thailand for forecasting heat index and
PM10. The warning criteria is divided into 4 categories and the results
shown on Google Maps.

3. Thermal index processing program

This program will import temperature and relative humidity data
between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM from 74 Meteorological Department
monitoring stations using the API to calculate and display the heat
index. The results are shown on Google Maps.

4. A simple toolkit for monitoring heat at
the community level.

The tool kit consists of (1) a thermometer and a relative humidity
meter, (2) a WBGT chart, and (3) a table of health effects.
The measurements are fast and simple, and the results can be instantly
communicated to the community.

5. Development of heat health warning
criteria and systems for Thailand.

The maximum temperature 3 days in advance from the Meteorological
Department is compared with the health impact monitoring value from
heat. The temperatures are divided into 4 levels, which are surveillance
level (35-38 °C), alarm level (38.1-40.0 °C), danger level (40.1-43.0 °C)
and very dangerous level (43.1°C). The information is then communicated
to the public.

6. Community-level heat warning system

This system uses the same criteria as number 5. above, and is
operated in March. The process is as follows: (1) Prepare the working
group, details of the weather forecast, identify vulnerable groups,
and alert the warning network (2) if the alarm is at level 2, the system
will issue 1 warning. If it is at level 3, 3 warnings will be issued daily
through channels such as the Village Health Volunteers and public
announcements. In addition, when the temperature is higher than
40 °C, home visits will be made.

7. Health Data Center

A big data system consisting of 6 components as follows:
(1) Population health information (2) Health status, infection of
significant communicable diseases (3) Service use rate of in/outpatients
(4) Accessibility of the public health services
(5) Maternal and infant health and nutrition (6) Reported mortality rate
in 298 disease groups.

8. Emergency and disaster response systems in medicine and public health

This system has an operation side consisting of medical and public
health professionals and a coordination side operated by the central
government to connect public health agencies at all levels. There is
an Emergency Medical Service, Medical Emergency Response Team
(MERT), mini-MERT, and Mental Health Crisis Assessment and
Treatment Team (MCATT).

9. Infectious Diseases Surveillance System

This system is a surveillance and utilization system at all levels to detect
anomalies, respond to emergencies and improve public health programs
that address critical issues from the grassroots to the national level.
The infectious disease surveillance system covers nine diseases, some of
which are linked to climate change.

10. Mosquito nets

Mosquito nets are used widely and are effective at reducing infection
and death rates from malaria.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

Box 2: Good Practice for Climate Change Adaptation in Public Health Sector
For the public health sector, examples of good practice for climate change adaptation
are the development of criteria and mechanism for heat warning as well as the heat
warning system at the community level in Thailand. The first part is related to the
development of heat health warning criteria and heat warning system. Under this
project conducted by the Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, research
on the health impact of heat is used in setting up critical threshold for temperature
that should trigger heat warning. In addition, this project also involves development
of measures to mitigate the health impacts of heat on the general Thai population
and the vulnerable groups, such as elderly, young children, etc. The second related
project is the project that emphasizes the heat warning system at the community
level. Under this project, manual for heat surveillance and warning was developed
and heat warning is issued to relevant government agencies and public through the
Department of Health website and Facebook fan page of the Department of Health.

4.3.5 Natural resources management sector
Most natural resource management adaptation measures consist of conservation,
restoration, and sustainable utilization, as well as encouraging participation of different
sectors related to natural resources, mainly those under the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environment. These include the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant
Conservation, responsible for forests and mangroves in protected areas and national
forest reserves, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, responsible for marine
and coastal areas, and the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning
office, responsible for preserving biodiversity and climate change planning and policies.
The actions taken by these agencies to adapt to climate change include:
1. Establishing protected areas both on land and at sea, such as national parks
and wildlife sanctuaries, and establishing protected areas while allowing sustainable use
especially in areas with ecological vulnerabilities. Doi Luang Chiang Dao, a mountain in
Chiang Mai, is one example of this; more are added regularly.
2. Forecast and warning systems such as warning for forest fires by the Department
of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation and Forestry Department and coral
bleaching warning by the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources.
3. Modeling climate change long-term impacts on forest ecosystems in the form
of a research project at the local level with the aim of establishing buffers and natural
connecting corridors.
4. Long-term resource monitoring to gather data for management planning, both
for terrestrial ecosystem and marine and coastal ecosystem.
5. Developing technological infrastructure to conserve and sustainably utilize
biodiversity such as the National Biobank that contributes information to the Thailand
biodiversity infrastructure (TH-BIF) and the Genome Bank that stores credible biodiversity
data for species conservation and research, such as the Sarus Crane.

145

CHAPTER 4
4.3.6 Human settlement and security sectors
Adaptation to climate change in the human settlement and security sector takes place
at 3 main levels, namely individual/household, community, and city-wide.
1. Adaptation at the individual/household level
The adaptation actions at the individual or household level depend on
the awareness and situation of the individual or household, such as raising the floor of
the house, building a flood prevention wall, having a second home, etc.
2. Adaptation at the community level
Examples of climate change adaptation at the community level are making
a walkway along the riverbank or planning to allocate community areas to accommodate
the impacts of climate change. However, adaptation at the community level requires
information and mechanisms to support participation, such as financing mechanism to
support adaptation action. Thailand has funding systems/funds to support climate change
adaptation, such as loan dedicated for post-disaster renovation. The Stable Home Project
of the Community Organizations Development Institute also provides funding for home
improvements to reduce the impact of disasters and the development of infrastructure,
facilities and public services.
3. Adaptation at the city level
As urbanization increases, cities are adapting to cope with the impacts of climate
change, such as creating public spaces, green areas, and infrastructure systems such as
dams and drainage systems.
For the human settlements and security sector, an example of a city in Thailand which
has concrete actions on climate change adaptation in human settlement is Udon Thani
province (see Box 3).
Box 3: Good Practice for Climate Change Adaptation in Human Settlement
and Human Security Sector
Udon Thani is a city with high economic expansion due to the increasing population.
As a result, the need for water is increased as well, coupled with climate pressure.
Consequently, Udon Thani faces problems with urban flooding, periods of rain and
water shortages, which sometimes lead to conflicts among water users. As a result,
urban services such as waterworks, waste disposal and wastewater management
are at risk of not being able to support the rapid growth of the city of Udon Thani.
In response, Udon Thani has established a data center system to inform decision
making by integrating space utilization planning and the design of institutions
that can adapt and respond to future climate change risks, including brainstorming
with stakeholders from various sectors in the district in city planning. Their
recommendations are as follows:
(1) Water management such as improving reservoirs or creating new microcities
for urban areas, development of integrated rainwater management to meet the
increasing demand for water supply.
(2) Wastewater treatment plants placement in appropriate areas.
146

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

(3) Network of green areas that connects to water sources and gives better
access.
(4) A “dynamic plan” in the Thai planning system to support sustainable
development in flood-prone areas.
(5) Developing incentive mechanisms to stimulate local government
organizations to provide reliable, standardized information.
(6) Establishment of an expert organization that can provide reliable
information and integrate adaptation ideas into law, to create effective enforcement
in city planning.

4.4 National adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, plans, goals, and actions
Given that Thailand is among the ten countries most vulnerable to climate risk over
the 2000-2019 period, Thailand has put climate change adaptation at the top national
agenda. Thailand has formulated the Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050), which is
a long-term policy framework to enhance low carbon emission and climate resilient society.
The Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050) was approved by the Cabinet on 14th July
2016. The Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050) sets out 3 key strategies including
climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation and low carbon development, and
enabling environment for climate change management. Under the climate change
adaptation strategy, adaptation measures and guidelines for 6 sectors were developed,
namely water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health,
natural resource management, and human settlement and security.
To provide clearer guidelines and framework on climate change adaptation, ONEP
developed the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The main objective of the NAP is to provide
guidance for mainstreaming climate change adaptation at sectoral and sub-national level
as well as guidance for budget allocation to finance climate change adaptation related
projects and programs. The NAP was approved by the National Climate Change Committee
on 19th November 2018. The vision of the NAP is “Thailand is resilient with adaptive
capacity to climate change impacts; and moves toward sustainable development.” The
NAP is composed of 3 missions: 1) to build climate-resilient development, by enabling
the integration of climate change adaptation guidelines and strategies in all sectors at all
levels; 2) to strengthen capacity and awareness of development partners at all levels to
implement policies and plans on climate change effectively; and 3) to develop databases,
research, knowledge, and technology to support climate change adaptation. Moreover,
guidelines and measures of the NAP provide framework for climate change adaptation
actions and the foundation to support relevant agencies to take actions. They are divided
into 6 key sectors related tothe adaptation strategy under the Climate Change Master
Plan (2015-2050), which are 1) water management, 2) agriculture and food security, 3)
tourism, 4) public health, 5) natural resources management, and 6) human settlements
and security. Table 4 contains a summary of targets and approaches for climate change
adaptation in each sector.

Provided that climate change adaptation is a long-term process and takes time,
the period of implementation under NAP is designed to be aligned and consistent
with the National Strategy and the National Economic and Social Development Plan.
The implementation period can be divided into 3 periods, namely the preparation
period (2018-2021), the implementation period (2022-2026) and the achieving goals
period (2027-2037). The preparation period emphasizes on laying a foundation and
pushing policy actions. The implementation period puts emphasis on the development
mechanisms and capacity building. Finally, the achieving goals period puts emphasis on
actions to achieve outcomes and goals. Figure 4-14 shows the underlying principles and
the objectives for climate change adaptation in each of the 6 sectors. The key
principles include sufficiency economy, sustainable development, human right and gender
responsiveness, community-based adaptation, proactive principle, resource efficiency,
good governance and public participation, local wisdom, and ecosytem-based adaptation.

148

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
To ensure efficiency and effectiveness in implementation of sectoral and area-based
climate change adaptation, sectoral focal points were determined. Details of these focal
points are contained in Table 5. Relevant agencies in these sectors are now in the
process of formulating specific sectoral plans to address climate change. For example,
with funding from BMU and collaboration between FAO, UNDP and the Office of
Agricultural Economics, the agriculture sector is developing an updated and more robust
climate change strategy and action plan for agriculture to align to the Climate Change
Master Plan (2015-2050) and as sectoral input into the NAP. Similarly, the Health National
Adaptation Plan phase 1 (2021-2030), which is also aligned with the Climate Change Master
Plan (2015-2050), places great emphasis on the development of National Public Health
and Climate Change System: Promotion, Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation.

In addition to the Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050) and the National Adaptation
Plan, there are sectoral plans that are linked to climate change adaptation, i.e., the Health
National Adaptation Plan (HNAP), Phase 1 (2021-2030) in the public health sector and
the Agriculture Strategic Plan on Climate Change (ASPCC) 2017-2021 in the agriculture and
food security sectors. Brief information about these two sectoral plans are as follows.
Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP)
The Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP), phase 1 (2021–2030) provides crucial

CHAPTER 4
In terms of disaster management, two main mechanisms are in place in Thailand, namely
the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act 2007 and the National Plan on Disaster
Prevention and Mitigation 2021-2027. The core concepts behind the National Plan on
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation 2021-2027 are the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)
and the Build Back Better and Safer. The National Plan on Disaster Prevention and
Mitigation 2021-2027 puts high emphasis on building capacity of local administration and
community engagement in disaster management, which will contribute to resilience,
sustainable disaster management and compliance with international guidelines.
The National Plan on Disaster Prevention and Mitigation 2021-2027 is consistent with
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk

4.5 Adaptation Priorities and Barriers
The barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation can be divided into two
types, i.e., sector-specific challenges and cross-cutting challenges. Table 4-9 summarizes
a summary of barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation actions in
each sector.
Table 4-9: Barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation actions in each sector
Sector

Barriers and Challenges

Water management

• Given that there are several government agencies involved in the water
resource management, integration and coordination in the execution
and implementation of adaptation actions play a crucial role. However,
at present, there is still limited integration and coordination among water
management related agencies.

Agriculture and food security

• Thai farmers lack knowledge in adapting to climate change and cannot
access technologies that help them adapt to climate change
• Thai farmers lack access to capital or finance that is necessary for
implementing adaptation actions

Tourism

• Tourists and tourism businesses lack knowledge of the impact of
climate change on the tourism sector as well as knowledge on how to
adapt to climate change.
• Inadequate dissemination and communication of climate change
impacts to domestic and international tourists as well as the tourism
businesses.
• Tourism businesses lack access funding to finance the adaptation
activities and the preparation of climate-resilient infrastructure.

Public health

• Public health personnel still lack awareness and knowledge of the
relationship between climate change and public health.
• Limited research on the climate-related diseases
• Lack of central database on the impacts of climate change on human
health both at the national and local level

Natural resource management

• Limited knowledge and research on the impacts of climate change on
ecosystems – both terrestrial and marine and coastal ecosystems.
• Environment-related government agencies at the local level lack
funding, personnel and knowledge to implement adaptation measures
to prevent natural resources and ecosystems from impacts of climate
change.

Human settlement and security

• Lack of downscaled climate change data at the local level to be used
for climate change adaptation planning

155

CHAPTER 4
The cross-cutting barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation measures
in Thailand are as follows:
• Limitation of knowledge: the personnel that are key to the implementation
of adaptation measures lack knowledge of the impacts of climate change and the
appropriate adaptation measures.
• Lack of continued financial support: some multi-year adaptation projects lack
continued financial support, slowing down the progress of adaptation actions.
• Lack of central database: different government agencies have their own climate
change data and lack coordination and integration of data on climate change projection
and impacts.
• Lack of national climate information center: Thailand does not have national
information center that compiles climate-related information.
• Lack of access to adaptation technologies: not all adaptation technologies
are accessible by stakeholders
4.6 Recommendations and Support Needed
So far, there have been several adaptation initiatives undertaken in water management,
agriculture, tourism, health, ecosystem, and human settlements and security in
Thailand, beingthose at the policy and planning level or actions on the ground.
However, there have also been barriers and challenges encountered in terms of insufficient
institutional capacities, limited knowledge and understanding of climate change
adaptation, ineffective system coordination, fragmentation of projects with
discontinued funding supports, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation system.
Given the implementation challenges combined with projected climate risks in both
the near and far future, it is essential that the whole national system for climate change
adaptation be strengthened to effectively and timely address the current and emerging
“Shocks” in order to prevent losses and damages to its economy, society, and environment.
The section below puts forward key recommendations for addressing the barriers and
challenges earlierindicated.
4.6.1 Key recommendations
1. System and Mechanism
Although the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and related adaptation strategic plans
have been well formulated to provide a clear policy direction and guidance for climate
adaptation actions across sectors in Thailand, they need to be supported with a system
that is unified and effective, being able to connect all related agencies with
well-functioning coordination mechanisms, common and accessible databases and
research information, knowledge sharing and innovation platforms, network of experts,
financing plans, and M&E system. Currently, the existing system has not well functioned,
and both general knowledge and technical capacities of related government agencies
in respect of climate adaptation have not been aligned to one another, resulting in
fragmentation of programme and projects formulated, budget allocated, and investments
undertaken. Insufficient coordination among agencies has currently hindered synergy for
collective efforts, and also efficiency of resource utilization (e.g. personnel, finance, etc.).
156

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
The national M&E system should be established to assess overall implementation
challenges and constraints, and to provide policy makers and main stakeholders with
accurate, evidence-based reporting, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing of ongoing
interventions with early indications of progress or challenges in the achievement of results.
The existing capacity building program for government agencies should be reviewed
and strengthened to be more strategic, aimed at enhancing their comprehensions and
competencies in designing and formulating adaptation related programmes and
projects, integrating climate change adaptation into their existing functional programmes/
projects, and being able to demonstrate adaptation co-benefits of their budget requests to
the policy makers and budget related agencies. Essentially, there is a need to evaluate
how the existing capacity building programme currently functions and how it can be
improved to enhance the nation-wide adaptation capacities.
2. Budget
With the current and future climate change risks projected, adaptation efforts require
greater amount of budget due to increases in frequency and magnitude of impacts as
well as multi-year investment requirements. However, the government budget is fairly
constrained as Thailand is projected to face multi-facet challenges in the future,
worsening the prospect for financing climate change adaptation. In this regard, the Thai
government must be more innovative and strategic in fund mobilization and utilization
to support adaptation actions.
In terms of fund mobilization, it is essential that innovative financing measures resting
on fiscal and monetary instruments (e.g., taxes, bonds, etc.) as well as private innovative
financing scheme (e.g., crowd funding) be initiated and experimented with an aim to
supplement the existing public budget that is too small to accommodate the larger scale
and magnitude of climate impacts. An emphasis should be placed on strategic short,
medium, and long-term financing plans to determine suitable financing sources (e.g.,
domestic, international, private) and appropriate types for different interventions.
With regards to fund utilization, it is more efficient and effective if such limited government
budget is geared toward investments that
• Are potentially beneficial to all related agencies; for example, investments in
the central database system, climate downscaling, technical capacity building, and risk
and vulnerability analysis. These types of investments would enhance cross-utilization
by different agencies and can support their designs and formulation on effective policy
and programme;
• Target vulnerable regions/population/sectors specified in the risk map analysis;
• Introduce technology that can be applicable and adaptable to different contexts;
• Emphasize adaptation measures that can be implemented with low investment
costs, but are highly shock responsive and also widely accessible to the public at large;
and
• Generate good practices, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing, leading to
upscaling, replication, and empowering innovation capacities.

157

CHAPTER 4
4.6.2 Support Needed
Based on the above recommendations to strengthen Thailand’s climate change adaptation
system to effectively address the current and future climate risks, key areas urgently
required for technical support can be identified as follows:
1. Data system
Technical support is required to strengthen the nationwide data system for climate change
adaptation across different spatial scales and sectors which is reliable and up-to date,
publicly available, and accessible by both national and sub-national government and
non- government agencies. Normally, there are different stages for climate adaptation
planning and implementation starting from (i) assessing climate impacts, vulnerability,
risks, and resilience, (ii) planning for adaptation, (iii) implementing adaptation measures,
and (iv) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation measures. Each stage also
requires different combinations of observed, forecast/projected, and historical
climate and socio-economic data. Hence, there are still ample rooms for technical support
to enhance both the provision of data (e.g., quality, availability, facilities, management,
etc.) and the uptake/utilization of such data (e.g., capacity to interpret and analyze climate
data for planning, programming, and decision making) across key adaptation sectors.
2. Monitoring and Evaluation System
Technical supports for designing and establishing the national monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system for climate change adaptation are essential for the long-term
success and effectiveness of adaptation actions that are in line with the National Adaptation
Plan and Strategy. Importantly, the M&E for climate change adaptation is different from
other regular M&E in a sense that the time frames associated with climate change and
the associated adaptation outcomes are likely to be longer. Moreover, there is uncertainty
associated with the magnitude and nature of climate change, particularly at the local
level, which can influence monitoring results and the ways in which they are evaluated. In
addition, a continually changing climate means that traditional approaches to measuring
change, such as comparing monitoring results to static baseline conditions, may not be
possible, and a moving baseline must be considered. In this regard, there are challenges
associated with the M&E for adaptation e.g., knowledge and understanding of budget
and policy related agencies with respect to the long time scale of climate change and its
impacts, capacities of related government agencies to formulate practical M&E process,
etc., and thus technical supports are required to address such challenges.

158

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
3. Financing mechanisms
Different venues for adaptation financing are essential for addressing the current constraint
of the government budget. Normally, several adaptation actions require substantive
upfront investments for climate-resilient infrastructure, and these may not yield
immediate benefits (due to the longer time frame associated with climate change)
envisaged by budget-related agencies and donors. Moreover, adaptation investments,
in nature, tend to be public goods that cannot easily leverage finance from the private
sector unless they are directly impacted. Also, several international climate-related funds
target mitigation rather than adaptation activities as the former yield immediate results
that can be realized now e.g., investments in energy efficiency improvements offer
immediate energy cost savings. Therefore, it is essential that Thailand receives technical
support to enhance the capacities of both finance and climate-related agencies
to initiate innovative financing measures that could sustainably support adaptation
investments in the future.

CHAPTER 5:

OTHER INFORMATION AND
RELEVANT ACTIVITIES

Climate actions entail other relevant activities that complement and empower
the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. These activities include
technology development and transfer; research and systematic observation; education,
training, public awareness, public participation, and public access to climate information;
capacity building; and information sharing and networking.
To illustrate, Thailand cannot successfully implement mitigation and adaptation measures
without having efficient climate technology or accurate climate knowledge and data to
fully consider the vulnerability of the current situation and enable proper climate policy
and decision-making process. Plus, the governmental agencies, the private sectors, and
the public cannot embrace fundamental change in their practices and ways of living to
reach carbon neutrality and climate resilience unless they have access to comprehensive
and accurate climate knowledge and information.
This chapter depicts the policy frameworks, key activities, and international cooperation
of Thailand's climate actions beyond mitigation and adaptation measures. First, it
describes Thailand's development of climate technology database and roadmaps,
key technology development, and its technology transfer mechanism. The climate
technology roadmaps and development align with key sectors stated in Thailand's NDC and
Thailand's NAP. Second, it reveals Thailand's research and systematic observation in
climate variable sectors: atmospheric, terrestrial (i.e., land and water), and oceanic domains.
Third, it articulates Thailand's Actions for Climate Empowerment (ACE) under Article 6 of
the UNFCCC, the core foundation for addressing climate change. The ACE involves
not only climate knowledge diffusion but also the environmental rights of the public to
participate and access climate information. Fourth, it covers a capacity-building
framework, national initiatives, and international cooperation. Finally, it explains how ONEP
acts as a primary entity for climate information sharing and how Thailand cooperates and
collaborates with international communities at bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels
to address climate change issues.

5.1 Technology Development and Transfer
5.1.1 Climate Technology Database and Roadmap
As emphasized in the Convention and the Paris Agreement, technology development and
transfer are essential elements supporting national climate actions, both for mitigating
and adaptation measures. Climate technologies can facilitate GHG emission reduction
and improve climate resilience. Aiming to promote technology development, Thailand
founded the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) and
the Office of National Higher Education Science Research and Innovation Policy
Council (NXPO), public agencies affiliated with the Ministry of Higher Education, Science,
Research and Innovation (MHESI). The NXPO, or former National Science Technology
and Innovation Policy Office (STI), is the National Designated Entity (NDE) of Climate
Technology Centre and Network: CTCN under the Convention. Following the research
162

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
project on Technology Needs Assessment (TNAs) and Technology Action Plans (TAPs)
for Climate Change Mitigation/Adaptation 2012, the NXPO has further elaborated
Climate Mitigation Technology Database and Roadmap 2019 and Adaptation Technology
Roadmap 2022.

Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)

Aligning with Thailand's Nationally Determined Contribution Roadmap on Mitigation
2021-2030, the Climate Technology Database and Roadmap 2019 was formulated
for energy, transport, IPPU, and waste sectors with different key technology fields.
The energy and transport sectors require technology development in 5 fields (i.e., public
electricity and heat production; manufacturing industries and construction; oil and natural
gas, energy consumption in residential, commercial, and agricultural sectors; and road
transport) which mainly focus on the energy management system, energy efficiency, fuel
switching, heat and power recovery, and renewable energy. The technology development in
the IPPU sector centers on cement production, targeting material efficiency and recycling.
The technology development in the Waste sector focuses on solid waste disposal on land
and wastewater handling, targeting energy management systems, material efficiency and
recycling, and energy efficiency.

The roadmap laid out GHG mitigation options, targets, capacity gaps and barriers,
technology options, current technology support, and resources in each technology
development field.
For Energy and Transport sectors, the target technology can be exemplified as follow:
• Public electricity and heat production: smart grid, energy storage, clean power
plant, nuclear power plant, fuel cell, combined heat and power, and renewable energy
• Manufacturing industries and construction: motor and driving system, bioenergy,
and burner, boiler, and stream system
• Oil and natural gas: enhanced oil injection and management and utilization
• Energy consumption in residential, commercial, and agricultural sectors: energy
management in building, electrical appliances, bioenergy, solar heat, and solar PV
• Road transport: Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), electric vehicles, hydrogen
and fuel cell, and bioenergy
For the IPPU sector in cement production focusing on material efficiency and recycling,
the target technology is clinker substitution. For the Waste sector, the target technology
can be exemplified as follows:
• Solid waste disposal on land: waste-to-energy, waste management and utilization,
Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), and reduce-reuse-recycle
• Wastewater handling: biogas and Vent/Flare Gas Recovery System (FGRS)

The Adaptation Technology Roadmap 2022 identifies technology assessment,
options, and priorities. It develops the technology database in the six priority sectors for
adaptation as identified in Thailand's NAP and illustrated in Chapter 4 "Vulnerability and
Adaptation": water management, agriculture, tourism, health, natural resources
management, and human settlement and security. Technology development priorities
in each sector are as follows:
• Water Management: (1) development of water situation forecasting and early
warning systems technology, (2) water retardation and flood retention technology, and
(3) groundwater management in conjunction with surface water uses in drought-prone
areas technology
• Agriculture: Climate Change adaptation technology of agriculture and food
security for precision farming for solving problems in the short, medium-term, and long
term is, therefore, necessary under the framework of Bio-Circular-Green Economic
Model, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Philosophy of Sufficiency Economy
(SEP) and related theories.
• Tourism: (1) Encourage different types of innovative tourism attractions and
activities to attract diverse tourist groups, (2) Development of seasonal tourism
destinations to support all-year-round tourism, and (3) Development of accurate and
precise early warning system.
• Health: (1) extremely hot weather early warning system, (2) an extensive public
health database which is an integrated database, and 3) network creation for warning,
disease surveillance, and good-practice community model to increase the efficiency of
the existing implementation and readiness for coping with emerging diseases.
• Natural Resources: (1) ecosystem-specific climate forecasting technologies,
which include short-term climate variability prediction and early warning systems and
long-term climate change projection of impacts on ecosystems; (2) technologies to
continuously measure and systematically assess ecosystems integrity including observation
technologies on physical and biological variables, and database technology; (3) technologies
to support conservation and restoration of ecosystems, habitat, species, and biodiversity
such as geo-informatics technology, advanced biotechnology and bioinformatics.
• Human Settlement and Security: 1) technology for planning and society
preparedness for urban changes, such as climate adaptation planning and infrastructure
planning; 2) the technology for resilient and adaptive human settlements, such
as information technology for flood adaptation and disaster or actionable intelligence
policy platform (space technology) for resilient spatial planning; 3) technology for risk
assessment, such as flood risk assessment for different sizes of cities.

5.1.2 Technology Development
Following the Climate Mitigation Technology Database and Roadmap 2019 and
Adaptation Technology Roadmap 2022, Thailand continues to develop technologies
necessary for addressing climate change. The development of climate mitigation
technology centers on GHG emission reduction, particularly in the energy sector, to achieve
carbon neutrality and net-zero emission according to the national targets and increase
competitiveness in global trade. For instance, EGAT and DEDE emphasize the significance
of energy transition toward clean and renewable energy sources with the development
of solar, wind, water, hydrogen, and waste and wastewater power generation. EGAT also
seeks to enhance the transition of transport fuel consumption by developing the electric
vehicle services such as EV-related technology and charging stations. The development of
climate adaptation technology targets the technologies that increase resilience,
strengthen forecasting and warning systems, and lessen the climate change impacts,
improving production efficiency and sustainable natural resources exploitation. In
particular, the LDD develops adaptation technology in the agriculture sector, such as
Geoinformatics or AquaCrop program to sustain agricultural production in the high
climate risk condition. Some examples of technology development projects are illustrated
in Table 5-1.

DEDE employs solar energy for power generation
and solar for heat generation (solar drying and
solar hot water systems). For wind power, the
implementation is limited due to the high investment
cost in materials and equipment. For waste, DEDE
developed a prototype of a biogas production
system from waste at a community level, supporting
up to 15 tons of organic waste per day. Energy
production from waste has been promoted using
two systems—the biogas production system and
Refused-Derived-Fuel (RDF). Wastewater, particularly
wastewater from the agro-industrial sector, is to
be treated by the anaerobic system generated by
product biogas with different levels of methane
contents. Methane has flammable properties that
can be used in renewable energy production.

5.1.3 A Mechanism for Technology Transfer
To facilitate and accelerate climate technology development and transfer,
the COP 2010 established the Technology Mechanism, comprising two bodies:
the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) and the Climate Technology Centre and
Network (CTNC). The CTCN is responsible for providing technical assistance at the request of
developing countries on technology issues, creating access to information and
knowledge on climate technologies, and fostering collaboration among climate technology
stakeholders via its network of regional and sectoral experts. The Office of

168

Designated Entity (NDE) of CTCN under the Convention. Its tasks are developing
a Climate Technology Database and Roadmap for Thailand and coordinating with CTNC and
other regional and international technology entities, enabling national climate technology
development and transfer. In addition, to promote low-carbon technology development
and circular economy as parts of Thailand NDC's goal, NXPO provides funding for
technology research and development and low-rate interest loans to private business sectors.

5.2 Research and Systematic Observation
Articulated in Article 4.1 (g) and Article 5 of the Convention and the Preamble of
the Paris Agreement, research and systematic observations are significant parts of climate
policy development and implementation. Research and systematic observations are vital
processes for developing climate system data archives and understanding climate change
causes, effects, magnitude, and timing based on the best available scientific knowledge
to adopt effective and progressive measures in response to climate threats.
In compliance with the Convention, Thailand prioritizes the development of science,
technology, and knowledge as one of the primary strategies for addressing climate
change. The 11th, 12th, and draft 13th National Economic and Social Development Plans
(2012-2037) seek to promote research and systematic observations in two aspects:
1) developing high skilled personnel and researchers and supporting systematic and
continuous research covering all aspects of natural disasters and climate change in
Thailand; 2) enhancing the efficiency of systematic observations and warning systems to
ensure the data precision, system coordination, risks coverage, and advance notification
to all vulnerable groups.
These objectives are reflected in the National Research Policy and Strategy (2018-2021)
and the Action Plan (2020-2022) formulated by the National Research Council of Thailand
(NRCT). This leading agency guides the country's development and public policy by using
research and integrating and administering the national research budget leading up to
the concrete utilization. Its core functions include funding research and innovations,
managing national databases and indicators on science and research, initiating
and supporting key research programs, and disseminating research knowledge to
relevant stakeholders. Similarly, Thailand Science, Research, and Innovation (TSRI) was
founded to encourage and support research and innovation involving science, technology,
social sciences, humanities, and interdisciplinary subjects. The goal of TSRI is to extend
the country's body of knowledge and drive its development through public policy
implementation and the utilization of research and innovation products for
socioeconomic purposes in a balanced and sustainable manner. To realize these goals,
relevant government agencies have conducted research and initiated observation
systems in climate variable domains: atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial domains.

5.2.1 Atmosphere/Satellite
The Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) operates under the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) framework. Aligning with the WMO Strategy Plan, the TMD’s Action
Plan 2020-2024 aims to enhance the monitoring, observing, and forecasting systems
ensuring that the meteorological data and service are “Actionable, Accessible, and
Authoritative: AAA” to cope with natural disaster and detrimental climate change
impacts. One of the WMO core strategies is ensuring the efficiency of the Global Climate
Observing System (GCOS) by implementing a fully integrated observation system that
will result in a clear observation standard with accuracy.
At present, TMD has 128 meteorological and atmospheric observing stations and
105 automatic observing stations. Some are upper air stations, but most are surface
stations operated 8 synoptic times daily at 00UTC, O3UTC, 06UTC, 09UTC, 12UTC,
15UTC, 18UTC, and 21UTC to provide climate data such as atmospheric pressure, air
temperature, humidity, and wind speed. All stations are equipped with standard
meteorological instruments, e.g., wet-bulb dry-bulb glass thermometers, wind
anemometers, Class-A evaporation pans, and rain gauges. Agro-meteorological stations
include soil thermometers. Data are recorded manually at the station in a log book and on
a PC to be sent as WMO-coded messages to the headquarter in Bangkok to be further
distributed via GTS and kept as archives in the climatological data section. Real-time
automatic weather reports are available to the forecasters and public (via web) and
separately archived. Data quality assurance/control is performed in real-time (on message
programming) and non-real-time (manually audits). Observers are directed to refreshing
courses, training, or seminar periodically.
Furthermore, Marine Meteorological and Upper-air Observations, a sub-division of
the TMD’s Meteorological Observations Bureau, is responsible for observing,
analyzing, and forecasting marine meteorological data as well as studying
the air-sea interaction phenomena. Also, the TMD and the Marine Department have
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on meteorological operations to
coordinate, link, and exchange meteorological data. This cooperation is an integration
of operations for joint development in providing channels to 1) obtain weather data
and sea conditions measured and observed from the vessels at sea (weather observing
data from ships at sea) to process meteorological information for forecasting and early
warning systems; 2) provide meteorological information to the vessels promptly which
will enable the vessels to make an accurate decision for navigation.
In addition, Thailand has employed satellite remote sensing observations in various
climate-related activities such as verifying heatwaves, hotspots of forest fires, and
areas vulnerable to climate hazards. The Geo-Informatics and Space Technology
Development Agency (GISTDA), a government agency overseeing the development of
geo-informatics, space technology, and satellite operations, is developing
the implementationof the Thailand Earth Observation System Phase 2 (THEOS-2).
THEOS-2 consists of one primary satellite and one small satellite with the multispectral

sensor as a core function. This function is highly linked to Essential Climate Variable. To
support evident-based policy for sustainable development, GISTDA is developing an
Actionable Intelligence Policy or “AIP,” which combines many spatio-temporal inputs,
including THEOS-2 products, with scenario simulations to generate multiple outcomes
from alternating area-based policies.

5.2.2 Land
The Office of the National Land Policy Board has approved the draft National Policy and
Plan on Land and Land Resources Management (2023-2037), setting a framework to
enhance optimal land utilization and the balance of the natural ecosystem in accordance
with the sustainable development which also contributes indirectly to climate change
mitigation and adaptation. The priority is to study problems and analyze the situation
where lands are abandoned and seek to design and create mechanisms, measures, or
incentives for converting those lands into forest or agricultural areas.

5.2.2.1 Agriculture
The Strategic Plan for Agricultural Research and Development (2023-2028), approved
by the Committee of Agricultural and Cooperative Development Policy and Plan, seeks
sustainable resource management to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate change
impacts, aligning with climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. To achieve
the goal, the Agricultural Research Development Agency aims to fund research
projects concerning: 1) sustainable and low-emission agriculture; 2) water management
for agriculture and enhance capacity, plans, and measures, to cope with natural
disasters and climate impacts. The research on agriculture mainly focuses on climate
change impacts on the agriculture sector, climate mitigation such as the potential of GHG
emission reduction in newly developed agricultural practices, and climate adaptation such
as agriculture in drought conditions. Key research projects are described in Table 5-2.

5.2.2.2 Forest
Forest Land Management Office (FLMO) was established by the Royal Forest
Department, with its core function to systematically observe, assess, and record
land use activities and changes in forest areas. The collected data is used for forest
management policy planning. From 2017 to 2019, the FLMO has observed and assessed
the status of forest resources in Thailand by utilizing satellite data of Sentinel-2, operated by
the European Space Agency, and LANDSAT 8, operated by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), to record high-resolution forest images. The data and
images were verified, analyzed, and used to categorize forests and formulate forest type
mapping and database. In addition, the Forest and Plant Conservation Research Office
was founded as a focal point for research and development with its objective to enhance
research in the fields complying with the strategies and core functions of the Department
of Natural Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation. The commitment to address climate
change under the Convention is one of the strategies laid out in its action plans. Various

5.2.3. Water
Three primary agencies taking part in observing and managing water resources in
climate-related variables are the Office of the National Water Resources (ONWR),
the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), and the Hydro and Agro Informatics
Institute (HII). The ONWR, operated under the Water Resources Act 2018, is in charge of
systematically regulating and managing integrated national water resources
management policies. Its mandates include studying and analyzing water situations and
operating as a single command center for water management at critical times. Under
the Irrigation laws, the RID aims to achieve, collect, store, control, distribute, drain, or
allocate water for agricultural, energy, household consumption, or industrial purposes. In
the 20-year rrigation Strategy (2017-2037), the RID seeks to utilize technology to enhance
water management efficiency and improve disaster prevention mechanisms. Playing
a complementary role, the HII acts as a data warehouse and knowledge library to
support efficient water management and expanded applications by building and
developing networks with more than 40 agencies. Its missions include enhancing
research and developing technology and innovation water resource information and
national water repository optimization. The programs and initiatives on water research,
systematic observation, and warning systems performed by the OWNR, RID, and other
related agencies can be illustrated in Table 5-4.

5.2.5 Participation in Global Research and Observation Systems
World Meteorological Organization and Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)
WMO facilitates and promotes the establishment of an integrated Earth System
observation network to provide weather, climate, and water-related data. WMO also
facilitates the establishment, maintenance, and continuing expansion of this global
network, the activities of which are coordinated within the Global Observing System
(GOS) of the WMO World Weather Watch (WWW). The WMO co-sponsored Global
Climate Observing System (GCOS) and Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) also
play a major role in improving the collection of required data for the development of
climate forecasts and climate change detection.
Thailand adhered to the Convention of the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) in 1949, became the nineteenth member of the organization, and has actively
participated in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) with the Thailand
Meteorological Department (TMD) as a national focal point. Some TMD’s meteorological
and atmospheric observing stations are assigned to be part of the Regional Basic Synoptic
Network (WMO-RBSN), Regional Basic Climatological Network (RBCN), GCOS Surface
Network (GSN), GCOS Upper Air Network (GUAN), Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW),
and Regional Basic Observing Network (RBON).
In addition, Thailand by the TMD has also collaborated with the WMO in various projects
concerning climate observation and warning systems. For instance, the TMD has joined
the Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) project for Southeast Asia of the WMO under
the CREW-SeA Canada Program Development. This project aims to provide advice and
improve the efficiency of various regional meteorological agencies in forecasting and
warnings of flash floods in Southeast Asia. Co-hosted with the ASEAN Secretariat and
the WMO, the TMD organized the 13th ASEAN Climate Outlook Forum (ASEANCOF) or
ASEANCOF-13 under the framework of the ASEAN Subcommittee on Meteorology and
Geophysics (ASEAN-SCMG) to provide knowledge and skills in observing, forecasting,
and disseminating severe climate information to ASEAN member states.

Committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS)
Committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS) was established in 1984 to coordinate
and harmonize Earth observations, enabling the user community to access and use data.
CEOS initially focused on interoperability, common data formats, the inter-calibration
of instruments, and common validation and inter-comparison of products. Over time,
the circumstances surrounding the collection and use of space-based Earth observations
have changed. Therefore, CEOS has evolved, become more complex, and expanded the
number and scope of its activities. CEOS now focuses on validated requirements levied
by external organizations, works closely with other satellite coordinating bodies (e.g.,
the Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites), and continues its role as the primary
forum for international coordination of space-based Earth observations. Currently, CEOS
has 34 organizations from 24 countries as key members and 29 international cooperation
organizations as its associates with their own observation satellites.
178

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
The Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), the main
space organization of Thailand operating within the Ministry of Higher Education, Science,
Research and Innovation (TISI), has become a member of CEOS since 2001. In 2009,
GISTDA served as a CEOS Chair. At the CEOS Plenary 2021 International Conference,
GISTDA was again elected to serve as CEOS Chair, commencing in November 2022.
The CEOS Chair is a senior space agency official that serves a one-year term as
the primary interface for all external coordination. The Chair reports to CEOS Agency
Principals at the annual CEOS Plenary session and ensures that their guidance and
direction are appropriately reflected in CEOS activities and priorities. The Chair also
presides over the Troika, which consists of three entities: the Chair him/herself, the future
CEOS Chair, and the past CEOS Chair. The Troika is a leadership mechanism the Chair
can use to discuss important topics.
Thailand's position as a CEOS Chair will be an opportunity to reveal the potential of
Thailand’s space technology and geospatial in the global arena. In particular, Thailand
commits to adopting space technology to address the climate change problem in line
with the CEOS' guidelines and mission.

Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling Project (SEACLID)/Southeast Asia
Regional Climate Downscaling (CORDEX-SEA)
CORDEX-SEA is the 14th domain of CORDEX, a program of the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP). CORDEX advances and coordinates the science and application of
regional climate downscaling through global partnerships. In CORDEX Global climate
model (GCM), outputs are "refinement" to produce "high-resolution climate change
scenarios." High-resolution climate change scenarios are the basic requirement for climate
change impact, vulnerability, and risk assessment studies at local and regional scales.
The Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling (SEACLID) was established as
a collaborative project in regional climate downscaling involving several collaborators
from various countries within the Southeast Asia region, adopting a common domain, and
obtaining climate information for the Southeast Asia region. SEACLID is mainly funded
by the Asia-Pacific Network (APN)'s ARCP programme. Initial member countries include
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. In
addition to the original member countries, collaborators from several countries, including
Australia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, Germany, and
Japan have joined the project. This project has involved many collaborators from 14
countries and 19 institutions. For Thailand, the main collaborators are Ramkhamaheng
University Center of Regional Climate Change and Renewable Energy (RU-CORE) and
Chulalongkorn University.
SEACLID has been streamlined and integrated into the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP)'s Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) and renamed
as SEACLID/CORDEX Southeast Asia (CORDEX-SEA). SEACLID / CORDEX-SEA aims to
downscale a number of CMIP5 GCMs for the Southeast Asia region through a task-sharing
basis among the institutions and countries involved. The SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA
179

CHAPTER 5
product enhances the scientific understanding of regional climate change. Consequently,
this project increase peer-reviewed publications on regional climate change, impacts,
and policy-related aspects and narrows knowledge gaps in the region. The first Phase
of CORDEX-SEA was completed in 2018 with the successful downscaling of 11 GCMs
with 7 RCMs. To date, more than 20 publications have been published from this project.
The SEACLID/CORDEX Southeast Asia Phase 2 focuses on the High-resolution
Analysis of Climate Extremes over Key Areas in Southeast Asia. The project has also led to
the establishment of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Information System (SARCCIS),
a data portal for sharing CORDEX-SEA data with end-users. SARCCIS is a data node of
the ESGF, hosted by the Ramkhamaheng University Center of Regional Climate Change
and Renewable Energy (RU-CORE).

and facilitating network-enabled research and education activities. These include research
collaboration, knowledge discovery and sharing, telehealth, and natural disaster mitigation.
APAN's member from Thailand is Thailand Research Education Network Association
established since 2007 to coordinate among researchers and users of research and
education networks and promote/support research projects and activities. From 2018-2021,
Hydro and Agro Informatics Institute (HII) has also joined APAN network conferences in
two working groups, the Disaster Mitigation Working Group (DMWG) and the Agriculture
Working Group (AgWG) to report on the progress of the work.

5.3 Education, Training, and Public Awareness
5.3.1 Policy and Institutional Framework for the Implementation of Article 6 of the
Convention
Stipulated in Article 6 of the Convention and Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, climate
education, awareness, training, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation are the core foundations for effective development and
implementation of climate policies and actions. These commitments under
the Convention can be referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE). In
the UNFCCC process, ACE is delivered through work programs. The latest program
adopted at COP26 in Glasgow reconfirms the significance of wide-range
stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and partnerships. By recognizing the critical
role of youth and their right to engage in decisions and action on climate change,
the program focuses on youth engagement in ACE implementation.
Adhering to the Convention, Thailand has integrated ACE components in various
national legal-based and policy-based instruments such as Thailand's Climate Change
Master Plan 2015-2050, Thailand's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and other
relevant national, sectoral, and local climate plans. For the institutional arrangement,
the Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP) within the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) was appointed as an ACE national
focal point to develop, execute, and coordinate ACE-related policies and
implementations. DEQP has prepared a draft Capacity Building for Climate Actions
2021-2025 as a foundation for its operation framework. Aligning with ACE goals and
Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), DEQP's operations aim to ultimately
transform people's behavior and enhance their understanding and capacity to cope with
climate impacts, according to the Convention and NDCs. DEQP, as ACE's national focal
point, has initiated and implemented various projects and activities to achieve ACE's goals.
In addition to DEQP's initiatives, many governmental entities also set out policies to

181

implement ACE activities fostering climate education, raising public awareness, and
providing training relating to their different core functions such as science, technology,
and renewable energy.

5.3.2 Initiatives and Programs under Article 6 of the Convention
5.3.2.1 Education
Climate change issues are incorporated into Thailand's education policies and schools'
curricula from the primary to higher levels, targeting youth engagement at the initial
stage of learning. The Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC), under the
supervision of the Basic Education Commission Board, developed the Basic Education
Core Curriculum 2008 (BECC), which included environmental education for sustainable
development in the Science Strand, one of the key learning standards and indicators.
In this strand, it focuses on the Change Processes of the Earth Standard topic, seeking
to develop an understanding of various processes on the Earth's surface and interior;
the relationship between various processes causing changes in climate, topography, and
form of the Earth; having an investigative process for seeking knowledge and scientific
reasoning; communicating acquired knowledge that could be applied for practical
purposes.
In addition, Thailand seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and
promote lifelong learning for all according to SDG 4. The achievement of SDG benefits
the objective of climate education by ensuring the resilience and adaptive capacity of
those most vulnerable to climate impacts—the youth, the disabled, and the poor. For
instance, Thailand has provided financial support for poor students using digital tools and
government funds, including the Education Equality Fund (EEF). Modern technology has
been applied to ensure equality in education, such as increasing access to high-speed
internet for schools in far-off areas. Thailand has also used the Information System for
Equitable Education, or iSEE, to target and monitor groups of students eligible for
financial support. Proxy Means Tests, innovative educational tools, have been applied
to find 2 million vulnerable students at the pre-primary and early secondary school level.
Education for disabled children has been improved to foster inclusive learning. This has
included projects that develop inclusive learning for all disabled students in schools,
projects that foster non-traditional learning for students with hearing disabilities, and a
project to provide sign-language interpreters in schools.
Furthermore, Thailand actively engages in climate actions to improve climate resilience
relating to SDG 13—Take Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change and its Impacts.
One of the key actions is to increase knowledge and awareness of climate change.
Thailand has integrated the knowledge of climate change into the national core curriculum
and indicators and standards for three subjects: (1) mathematics, science, and geology;
(2) social studies, religions, and culture; and (3) physical and health education.
The Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP) published the Environmental
Studies Activity Manual. The manual contains climate change knowledge for teachers to
use as a teacher's manual and for the interested public. These manuals were distributed to
182

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
related organizations and schools in the network. DEQP, together with Thailand Research
Fund and Bangkok University, implemented the project “YouthEN for Climate Change
Forum 2019” to enhance the capacity of young generation in terms of climate change
knowledge, including the role of youth in the global community. With the support from
Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), DEQP and TGO organized the “ACE Youth Camp 2020” to enhance knowledge,
exchange learning experiences, brainstorm ideas on low-carbon city innovations,
build capacity, and expand the youth climate network.

5.3.2.3 Public Awareness
In recent years, the level of public awareness on climate change issues in Thailand has
increased significantly due to continuous efforts of various stakeholders to implement
awareness-raising activities, the publication of scientific reports, the intense global
climate movement, and accessible online media and social media platforms. Aligning with
the ACE program, DEQP and other government agencies regularly launch public awareness
campaigns on climate change, which extend well beyond formal education or training
programs through social media, electronic communication, and events or by partnering
with urban and rural local communities. The activities and campaigns aim to inform the

185

CHAPTER 5
public about the causes and impacts of climate change and actions that the public can
contribute to addressing climate change. The DEQP alsodeveloped assessment tools,
such as surveys on knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and practices to establish public
awareness of climate issues, which can serve as a basis for further work on climate
education, training, and awareness-raising. The key activities are illustrated in Table 5-8.

Furthermore, government agencies and environmental organizations use market-based
instruments “Green Label” or “Carbon Label” to promote environmentally friendly
production and consumption of energy, products, and services. For instance, the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) employs “Energy Saving Label No.5”
186

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
and “Energy Efficiency for House and Green Schools” to raise public awareness of energy
efficiency and conservation, promote Circular Economy, decrease energy consumption,
reduce energy importation, and reduce GHG emissions. Also, Thailand Environment
Institute (TEI), in association with the Ministry of Industry, launched the “Green Label”
in 1994. The Green Label is an environmental certification awarded to specific products
shown to have minimum detrimental impacts on the environment compared with other
products serving the same function. The Thai Green Label Scheme applies to products
and services, not including foods, drinks, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the Green
Leaf Foundation runs the “Green Leaf Label” to certify hotels and tourism activities that
ensure energy efficiency, environmental protection, pollution reduction, and natural
resources conservation in their management and services. For the carbon labels, Thailand
Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) developed carbon label projects
for products and corporates, as described in Chapter 3. TGO also developed the label
“CoolMode” which represents the label certifying cool, comfortable, and easy-to-clean
clothes. Wearing “CoolMode” clothes can help reduce energy use in air conditioners
and washing machines as well as reduce water consumption.

5.3.2.4 Public Participation
Those affected by the decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making
process. Providing the public with an opportunity to share their views and perspectives
in decision-making processes enhances the quality of decisions. It often results in a high
compliance rate with the policy or regulation being implemented. Thai Constitution 2017
guarantees the right of public participation in environmental management according to
Section 57 (2) and the environmental policy-making process in Section 65.
As a result, public participation in the policy-making process is the key commitment
that has been carried out in various climate policy development, such as stakeholders'
consultation and engagement during the preparation of the 13th National Economic and
Social Development Plans, Thailand's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), National
187

CHAPTER 5

Adaptation Plan (NAP), and UNFCCC's related reports. In particular, public hearings have
been organized for the preparation process of Thailand's National Communications to
the UNFCCC, Biennial Update Reports, Mid-Century, Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas
Emission Development Strategy (LTS), and updated Thailand's Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC).
For public participation in environmental management, Section 57 stated that the State
shall conserve, protect, maintain, restore, manage, and use or arrange for utilization of
natural resources, environment, and biodiversity in a balanced and sustainable manner,
provided that the relevant local people and local community shall be allowed to participate in and obtain the benefit from such undertaking as provided by law.
Following this founding, DEQP and other governmental entities have enhanced public
participation in activities and measures relating to climate actions and environmental
sustainability. Some activities are depicted in the Table 5 9.

and all relevant stakeholders, set up a waste
management system in the coastal areas and fisheries
communities. The objective is to enhance community
participation in marine resource conservation and
waste management. Fishing vessels are encouraged to
avoid using undegradable containers and dumping
those in the sea. The operation requires fishing
vessels to collect, record, and report the amount of
waste collected. All registered ports have a spot to
sort wastes to reuse and recycle. As of 2021, overall
collected waste from the sea totaled to 182,876
kg, consisting of fishing nets, plastic bottles, glass
bottles, and other waste.

5.3.2.5 Public Access to Information
ACE reinforces that information on the climate crisis should be readily accessible and
freely available to the public, so they are equipped with the tools to play an active,
meaningful role in climate policy and action. Thus, the right of public access to information and
the state's duty to disclose information are necessary for enhancing public awareness of
climate change and ensuring the state's transparency and good governance.
This right is endorsed in many legal instruments and climate-related policies and plans
in Thailand. Section 59 of the Thai Constitution 2017 stated that the State shall disclose
any public data or information in the possession of a State agency, which is not related
to the security of the State or government confidentiality as provided by law and shall
ensure that the public can conveniently access such data or information. This right is
also guaranteed by the Official Information Act 1997 to ensure transparency and good
governance in the administration. In Section 6 of the Enhanced and Conservation of
the National Environmental Quality Act 1992, any individual has the right to obtain
information and news from the government in matters related to the enhancement and
conservation of environmental quality.
In compliance with these legal foundations and the ACE program, Thailand has
constantly improved its performance in enabling public access to climate information in
the following elements:
• Increase the availability and accuracy of the information, academic publications,
law and regulations, and other related materials
• Widely disseminate information on climate change and improve public access
to information at all administrative levels by using various channels and mechanisms
adapting to communities, groups, and individuals
• Ensure that the information provided is up to date
189

CHAPTER 5

The most effective communication mechanism for disseminating up-to-date climaterelated information, research, work progress, and target achievement is government
agencies' official web-based or social media platforms in charge of climate-related tasks. For
instance, ONEP, a national focal point of the UNFCCC, provides a database for
the national GHG Inventory, a risk database system by area, and other climate-related
information. Environmental Research and Training Center (ERTC), under the supervision of
DEQP, compiles all research on climate change issues from 2007 to 2018 (in total of 1,389
articles) in these six areas: the science of climate change, GHG emissions, and elimination,
climate change impacts, climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, climate
change policy. All articles are grouped and shared via its official website.

5.3.3 Regional and International Cooperation to Promote Education, Training, and
Public Awareness
As regional and international cooperation can strengthen and accelerate the national
implementation of ACE works, Thailand has joined forces with regional and international
communities to foster the exchange of good practices and lessons learned from ACE
implementation.
As an ASEAN member state, Thailand participates in the ASEAN Working Group on
Environmental Education (AWGEE), a subsidiary body under the ASEAN Senior Official
on the Environment (ASOEN), leading the technical and operational implementation of
AWGEE Action Plan 2016-2020. The AWGEE was established as a consultative forum to
promote coordination and collaboration among ASEAN sectoral bodies and dialogue
partners to ensure a well-coordinated and integrated approach to promoting environmental
education in the ASEAN Member States (AMS) and ASEAN Dialogue Partners (Australia,
Canada, China, European Union, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Russia,
and the United States). According to the 11th AWGEE meeting in 2019, key activities of
member states include:
• ASEAN Eco-Schools Program aims to create a school culture geared toward
environmental protection and preservation through management, commitment, and
infusion into the curriculum, co-curriculum, and greening and cleaning activities.
• ASEAN Green Higher Education Program, led by the Philippines and Thailand,
aims to generate baseline data on eco-friendly initiatives of colleges and universities
in the ASEAN Region, including (i) a review on the state of the greening of higher
education institutions among AMS; (ii) review the ASEAN Eco-schools Guidelines to
include a higher education category; and (iii) target the inclusion of a higher education
category in the NEXT ASEAN Eco-schools Awards.
• ASEAN Plus Three Youth Environment Forum (AYEF) is organized regularly to
promote awareness and enhance the participation and cooperation of youth in
environmental protection efforts. The hosting of the AYEF is on a voluntary basis.
A Philippine delegate was sent to Singapore in 2018, and Thailand volunteered to host
the 2019 AYEF.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

At the international level, Thailand steadily participates in the annual in-session ACE
Dialogues under the UNFCCC, a regular forum for Parties and other stakeholders to share
their experiences and exchange ideas, good practices, and lessons learned regarding
ACE implementation.
In addition, Thailand also participates in two flagship networks that serve as parts of
the Education on Sustainable Development (ESD) project launched by the United Nations
University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS): Regional Centres
of Expertise on Education on Sustainable Development (RCEs) and the Promotion of
Sustainability in Postgraduate Education and Research Network (ProSPER.NET).
The first is a global network of Regional Centres of Expertise on Education on Sustainable
Development (RCEs), a network of existing formal (schools and universities), non-formal,
and informal organizations (e.g., NGOs, media, and community leaders.) that facilitate
learning toward sustainable development in local and regional communities. Its goals are:
1) Re-orient education toward SD, covering existing programs/subjects from the point of
ESD, and designing and integrating SD in curricula. ESD programs are tailored to address
issues and the local context of the community in which they operate; 2) Increase access
to quality education that is most needed in the regional context; 3) Deliver trainers' training
programs and develop methodologies and learning materials for them; and 4) Lead
advocacy and awareness-raising efforts in public about the importance of educators and
the essential role of ESD in achieving a sustainable future. RCEs promote the long-term
goals of ESD, such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and improvement of
the quality of life.
The second is a network of higher education institutions called the Promotion of
Sustainability in Postgraduate Education and Research Network (ProSPER.NET), an alliance
of leading universities in the Asia-Pacific region committed to integrating sustainable
development into postgraduate courses and curricula. ProSPER.Net was founded in June
2008 within a broader international agenda that recognizes the importance of education
and research to help build a more sustainable future. Five universities from Thailand are
members of ProSPER.Net: Asian Institute of Technology, Chulalongkorn University, King
Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Mahidol University, and Prince of Songkla
University. These universities provide extensive programs and research collaborations on
sustainable development and climate change.
Furthermore, Thailand is a member of Global Learning and Observations to Benefit
the Environment (GLOBE), an international effort to bring students, science teachers,
scientists, and local communities together to carry out research on Earth System Science
(ESS), including climate change context. The Institute for the Promotion of Science and
Technology (IPST) was appointed as Thailand's GLOBE coordinator. With GLOBE
collaboration, IPST implemented numerous activities promoting climate education,
training, and public awareness. IPST works closely with teachers and students in schools
within the Education Office of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the Ministry
of Education, universities in different regions of the country, pertinent departments in

5.4 Capacity Building at the National and Sub-Regional Levels
5.4.1 Policy and Institutional Framework for the Implementation of Article 11 of
the Paris Agreement
Capacity-building is a fundamental building block for ensuring the successful
implementation of climate policies and actions. It enables individuals, government
agencies, private sectors, and societies to effectively address climate change issues by
employing mitigation or adaptation measures. Capacity-building is involved in many
Articles of the Convention, such as Articles concerning climate adaptation, research,
technology transfer, education, and training. The Paris Agreement further emphasized
the significance of capacity-building in Article 11, which defines capacity-building-related
goals, guiding principles, and procedural obligations for all Parties. It urges developed
countries to support capacity building in developing countries and developing country
Parties to communicate progress on implementing capacity-building plans regularly,
policies, actions, or measures. Since the establishment of the Convention in 1992,
the institutional architecture addressing capacity building in the UNFCCC process
has been evolving. At COP21, the Paris Committee on Capacity-Building (PCCB) was
established as a newly constituted body to address current and emerging capacity needs
and gaps and further enhance capacity-building efforts. The PCCB has been tasked with
managing and overseeing the capacity-building work plan for the period 2016–2020.
At COP24, the Capacity-building Hub was formed to be a space for representation,
collaboration, and knowledge sharing. At COP26, the 3rd Capacity-building Hub emphasized
several issues, including 1) the inclusion of women and youth, multiple languages, and all
traditionally marginalized voices is key to success; 2) Locally owned, long-term, sustainable
capacity-building is highly favorable to the traditional method of ad hoc, foreign-led,
temporary initiatives.
Thailand sets a high priority on enhancing capacity-building in climate actions and
sustainable development. Thus, capacity-building has been incorporated into many
national, sectoral, and local government plans and programs, such as the National
Economic and Social Development Plans, National Adaptation Plan, and Thailand's
Nationally Determined Contribution. Thailand's Climate Change Master Plan (CCMP)
2015-2050 also targets achieving climate resilience, developing capacity, and enhancing
stakeholders' involvement at all levels. Capacity-building, particularly in the adaptation
context, is the key to achieving CCMP's goals in all three phases: short, middle, and
long terms. Thailand also strives to enhance its national capacity to cope with climate
change relating to SDG 13—Take Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change and its
192

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Impacts. In terms of the prevention and mitigation of adverse effects of climate-related
disasters, various capacity-building programs have been conducted for personnel of
district centers, provincial offices, and other local agencies to enhance their knowledge and
capacities regarding the formulation of local disaster prevention and mitigation plans and
the alignment of such plans with the National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plan 2015.

5.4.3 Regional and International Cooperation to Promote Capacity Building
Regional and international cooperation are necessary for enhancing Thailand and the
global community's capacity to respond to the challenge of climate change. The United
Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat and the
Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) established the Regional Collaboration
Centre (RCC) Bangkok in September of 2015 to provide hands-on support to governments,
NGOs, and the private sector in Asia and the Pacific region to develop their mitigation
efforts through capacity building, direct technical assistance, and
strategic networking.
At the regional level, the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO)
launched the Climate Change International Technical and Training Center (CITC)
with support from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 2014 to serve as a
knowledge hub and training platform to help meet the needs of ASEAN stakeholders
to develop their capacity. The center's objectives include promoting collaborative
initiatives and addressing common and specific challenges among the ASEAN Member
States and stakeholders. This is accomplished by sharing experience and knowledge at
the intra-regional, sub-regional, and bilateral levels. In 2021, the United Nations Office
for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), TGO, and JICA jointly published "South-South
in Action: Capacity Building for Climate Actions in Southeast Asia," which elaborates
TGO/CITC's climate change capacity-building activities and programs. It highlighted
five primary cases: Regional Training on Climate Change (Mitigation, Adaptation, and
Climate Finance), engagement with the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change
(AWGCC) and ASEAN Climate Change Partnership Conferences, Bilateral South-South
Cooperation between TGO/CITC and Viet Nam, TGO/CITC Regional Conferences, and
Strategic Engagement in United Nations Climate Change Conferences.
As a result of the successful execution of the CITC, TGO decided to expand the capacity
building activities and collaboration by integrating the CITC and other training and
outreach programs into a newly established TGO Climate Action Academy (CAA) which
focuses on enhancing competence in climate change issues both in Thailand and the

194

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION

Southeast Asia region. CAA aims to develop the capacity for personnel in climate change
management in Thailand, especially senior executives and leaders from all sectors, to
have knowledge and understanding of their roles in promoting the circular economy
to achieve maximum productivity, energy efficiency, minimum waste, and greenhouse
gas emissions reduction and to promote the consumption of products with low carbon
emissions and create a low carbon society. Recently, TGO by CAA, in collaboration
with JICA and ONEP, organized the "ASEAN Workshop on preparing for the Enhanced
Transparency Framework under the UNFCCC" through the Zoom program for 52 trainees
from 6 ASEAN countries to build an understanding of the MRV Report and the Enhanced
Transparency Framework (ETF).
Furthermore, Thailand is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Network for Global
Change Network (APN), an intergovernmental network addressing global change
and sustainability through innovative and transdisciplinary research and capacity
development activities that support policy development and implementation. The APN
supports research and science-based response strategies, including climate change.
It also focuses on linking scientific outcomes with policy mechanisms applicable to all
levels of governance and societal sectors in each country. The APN, through its scientific
capacity development program (CAPaBLE) supports activities that enhance capacity at
individual, organizational and systemic levels. Examples of latest activities include the
capacity building programme on developing project proposals for climate change
adaptation for Northeast Thailand; capacity building for measuring multi-hazard
livelihood security and resilience in the Lower Mekong Basin; and scientific capacity
building in assessing the coastal dynamics (land-use, biodiversity & ecosystem services)
including the influence of climate change in the coastal zone – toward a locally adapted
Marine Spatial Planning (MPS) Framework.

5.5 Information Sharing and Networking
5.5.1 Information Sharing
The Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP) was
assigned to be a national focal point of the UNFCCC in 2004. The Climate Change
Management and Coordination Division (CCMC) within ONEP is responsible for three
main tasks: 1) advising and proposing policy, plan, and measures for climate change
mitigation and adaptation; 2) tracking and coordinating public sectors and private
sectors' works on climate change; 3) disseminating information relating to climate change
policies, plans, initiatives, and activities. ONEP acts as a coordinator and informationsharing hub for climate change networking at national, regional, and international levels.

195

CHAPTER 5

ONEP is developing an information system, a database of the International Collaboration
Program on Climate Change. It is designed to categorize data aligning with the Climate
Change Master Plan 2015-2050. It is also open to government agencies, the private sector,
and international organizations to search for project information in the system to reduce
redundancy in operation, serve as a building block for future climate projects, and to be
used in negotiations on international cooperation on climate change. The objectives of
this database are:
• To gather information on international cooperation projects under the climate
change framework.
• To create a database information system for the implementation of international
cooperation projects on climate change in Thailand for gap and needs analysis and
support policy and decision-making for international cooperation on climate change.
• To acquire recommendations and guidelines for the implementation of
international cooperation projects on climate change in the future to be used for
determining Thailand's negotiation strategies in the framework of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation on climate change.

5.5.2 Networking
Thailand has cooperated and collaborated with bilateral, regional, and multilateral
partners to strengthen climate technology development, research and observation,
education and awareness raising, capacity building, and other climate actions. These
collaborations can also be observed in mitigation and adaptation measures in Chapter 3
and 4. Many national climate initiatives and activities received support from international
communities, both bilateral and multilateral levels, which will be further discussed in
the next chapter. Through networking at all levels, Thailand advances national climate
implementation, fulfilling its commitments to the Convention, contributing to global
climate mitigation, and strengthening its capacity to cope with climate impacts.
At regional level, as part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Thailand
has cooperated to address climate change in a regional collaboration platform through
the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change (AWGCC). In 2019, on behalf of the ASEAN
Chairmanship, Thailand took the lead in ASEAN's initiatives and activities on climate
actions as follows:
• Developing ASEAN Joint Statements on Climate Change and communicating
to United Nations multilateral mechanisms aiming to reaffirm the ASEAN's
commitments and priorities toward achieving the goals of UNFCCC and the Paris
Agreement. First, the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change to UNFCCC COP25 was
communicated by HE Mr. Varawut Silpa-archa, Thailand's Minister on Natural Resources
and Environment, at COP25 held in Madrid. Besides the annual statement to COP,
the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change to the UN Climate Action Summit
2019 was delivered by Thailand's Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha during UN
General Assembly held in New York.

CHAPTER 6:

CONSTRAINTS, GAPS, NEEDS, AND
SUPPORT RECEIVED

Thailand has received support from various international partners to facilitate climate
actions in mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment, including the preparation
of Thailand's Fourth National Communication (NC4) and Third Biennial Update Report
(BUR3) to the UNFCCC. From 2020-2022, Thailand has received support from multilateral
and bilateral partners for a total of 34 projects, entailing 18 mitigation projects with a total
amount of 31,438,771 USD, 10 adaptation projects with a total amount of 48,667,056 USD,
and 6 enabling environment projects with a total amount of 3,419,548 USD. Most support
was a combination of technical support and capacity building.
The international support enables Thailand to overcome its constraints, gaps, and barriers
to climate action. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation for
all the support.
However, considering remaining constraints and gaps, Thailand still needs international
support in terms of finance, technical expertise, technology transfer, and capacity building
to ensure the achievement of LT-LEDS in a short-term period (2025-2035), a mid-term
period (2040-2050), and a long-term period (2050-2065). More support is needed,
particularly for technology development and transfer, which is essential for mitigation
and adaptation implementation. For mitigation, Thailand needs support for the energy
transition toward renewable sources focusing on renewable energy technologies (such as
solar and wind), enhancing the potential use of Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) & Carbon
Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies, and developing other technologies
to achieve GHG emission reduction and a net-zero emission. For adaptation, support is
needed for developing a data map showing areas at risk of climate change impacts and
accessible viable adaptive technology. To enhance the enabling environment, Thailand
requires support for developing and strengthening mechanisms, instruments, and policy
implementation, such as financial instruments and incentives to engage private sectors in
green investment and capacity building for all stakeholders to integrate climate actions
into their respective practice and plans.

6.1 Constraints, Gaps, and Needs
Abiding by its commitments under the Convention, Thailand has unceasingly undertaken
climate actions in mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment. Still, constraints
and gaps remain primarily regarding access to finance, technical expertise, technology
development and transfer, and capacity building. Support from international communities
will help Thailand overcome these impasses and expose its full capacity to implement
climate actions.
This section reports constraints, gaps, and the international support needed for the
climate implementation of three areas: mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment.
This information was obtained from the priorities stipulated in the LT-LEDS for Thailand’s

200

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
transition to carbon neutrality and net-zero GHG emissions and the result of stakeholders’
consultation via focus group meeting. The stakeholders include all relevant government
agencies overseeing climate change measures in respective sectors.
Under each area, a conclusion of constraints and gaps is accentuated, and a description
of support needed is briefly summarized in the Tables and categorized into four groups
as follows:
a. Technology Development and Transfer (TT): support needed to develop and
transfer innovative and practical technologies to support Thailand's actions on climate
change, particularly the development of infrastructure and climate-related technology
such as EV infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, and GHG reduction technology
b. Technical Support/Assistance (TS): non-financial assistance needed from
international specialists, can take the form of sharing information and expertise,
the transmission of working knowledge, and consulting services and may also involve
the transfer of technical data, know-how and knowledge. This may include but not be
limited to the support in policy development and implementation, development of
mechanisms and instruments, climate information, and M&E systems.
c. Capacity Building (CB): support needed for developing and strengthening
the skills, abilities, processes, and resources of organizations and stakeholders for planning
and taking climate actions. This includes support for preparing the forthcoming National
Communications and Biennial Update Reports.
d. Financial Support (FS): support needed in the form of money or financial
instruments such as a grant, soft loan, equity, or guarantee to support and leverage
government and private sector investment in climate actions, particularly for incremental
cost or risk premium required to make the investment of climate action viable, or to cover
specific activities such as technical assistance or capacity building

6.1.1 Mitigation
As Thailand intends to become carbon neutral by 2050 and achieve net-zero GHG
emissions by 2065, the priority is given to research development and deployment on
mitigation measures reducing GHG emissions, particularly in the energy and transport
sector. The energy sector, the most significant contributor to Thailand's GHG emission,
has a vital role in implementing climate mitigation measures. The latest adoption of
the National Energy Plan 2022 articulates elevated targets to enhance energy
efficiency, increase renewable energy production, transition toward green energy for
transportation, and transform the energy business structure to embrace energy transition.
The industrial development strategy also reflects the urge to stimulate the green growth
engine focusing on environmentally friendly technology development and renewable
energy transition. Despite being a modest contributor to GHG emissions, the waste
sector aims to eliminate the waste from its production sources for sustainable waste
management by employing three principles: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. The National
Solid Waste Management Master Plan also seeks to enhance energy production and
organic fertilizer from waste.

201

CHAPTER 6
Constraints and gaps
The core constraint of realizing the mitigation targets and measures is to balance
between securing energy production and reducing GHG emissions. The energy transition
requires high technical capacity, technology advancement, and sufficient investment funds,
particularly for technology and infrastructure development costs. While attempting to
reduce GHG emissions, the Energy sector must secure energy supply bearing the cost
of energy types, prices, and governmental policy on fossil fuels, which affect overall
national economic growth. Thus, it is vastly challenging to maintain the equilibrium
between energy security, economy, and environment. For the transport sector, the main
barrier is limited resources and funding to develop and implement climate mitigation
initiatives such as investment in electrification of transport and battery charging
technologies, road-to-rail model shift for both freight and passenger transport, or
awareness-raising for increased use of public transportation. For the waste management,
limited financial resources, capacity, and technology development at subnational and
local levels for waste management systems remain key obstacles, such as insufficient
knowledge and development of GHG reduction technology for wastewater treatment
and inadequate financial resources, technical capacity, and technology for producing
energy from waste.
Support Needed
Thailand's mitigation measures focus on the Energy, IPPU, Agriculture, and Waste
sectors accountable for overall national GHG emissions. In addition, with growing
attention on the nature-based solutions for climate mitigation, forests and their
carbon sequestration capacity have become subjects of research and technology
development. Support in various types is still needed to ensure the achievement of
LT-LEDS in a short-term period (2025-2035), a mid-term period (2040-2050), and
a long-term period (2050-2065), particularly for the followings:
Energy, IPPU, and transport:
• In a short-term period, Thailand urgently needs support for the energy
transition toward renewable sources focusing on renewable energy technologies (such as
solar and wind); approaches in advanced energy storage system (EES) and demand-side
management; and development of electric vehicle (xEV), battery, and infrastructures;
and increasing grid modernization, smart energy management, and Independent Power
Supply (IPS).
• In a mid-term period, Thailand needs support to enhance the potential use of
Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) & Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS
technologies in industries and power plants, and Bioenergy with CCS.
• In a long-term period, Thailand needs support to develop other technologies
to achieve GHG emission reduction and a net-zero economy (e.g., Hydrogen or
Bio-hydrogenated diesel)
Agriculture and waste
• In a short-term period, support is needed for enhancing the GHG reduction
technologies in the agriculture and waste sectors such as Methane reduction in rice
cultivation, waste and wastewater treatment, and waste-to-energy technology.

202

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
• In a mid-term period, Thailand needs support in developing technologies for
soil and manure management and water usage reduction and circulation.

6.1.2 Adaptation
Thailand is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. According to the Global Climate
Risk Index 2021, Thailand was ranked the 9th most affected country in terms of human
impacts and direct economic losses from weather-related loss events during 2000-2019.
Aiming to increase adaptive capacity and climate resilience, Thailand has formulated
the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to be an implementation framework to integrate climate
change adaptation into the sectoral and local strategic plans, covering six priority sectors,
including water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health,
natural resources management, and human settlements and security. The objectives are
1) to increase water security and decrease losses and damage from water-related disasters,
2) to maintain productivity and food security amidst climate change risks and impacts,
3) to strengthen the capacity of the tourism sector toward climate resilience and sustainable
development, 4) to establish effective public health systems to manage risks and reduce
impacts from climate change, 5) to sustainably manage biodiversity resources to respond
to climate change impacts, and 6) to enhanced capacity of individuals, communities, and
cities, to adapt to climate change impacts appropriately according to the local context.
Constraints and gaps
The fundamental barriers to the implementation of adaptation measures are 1) unfinished
development of a central database and insufficient data integration and coordination on
climate change projection and impacts, 2) lack of a national climate information center
compiling climate-related information, 3) insufficient knowledge and research on climaterelated risks for key stakeholders to comprehend and implement appropriate
adaptation measures, 4) limited access to adaptive technology, and 5) inconsistent
financial supports and distribution. For instance, the health sector still requires research
on climate-related risks, a central database identifying climate impacts on human health
at local and national levels, and uniform distribution of resources in terms of healthcare
budget and technical experts. Similarly, the water management sector requires knowledge
development for forecasting models, a central water resource and climate change database,
and institutional arrangement for uniform budget distribution and climate measures
implementation.
Support Needed
According to the ONEP database, support is needed primarily for:
• Developing a data map showing areas at risk of climate change impacts.
The map should show an overview and data on a specific sector (e.g., showing drought
and floods for water management and agriculture sectors or showing ecological risks or
disasters for the tourism sector)
• Developing assessment data on climate change impacts, using both models
and observation data. The data includes loss or damage from impacts and effects on
ecosystems, watershed cycle, life cycle of insects, various pathogens, and outbreaks of
pathogens, including their impacts on food security, tourist attractions, and communities
that settle near or rely on such natural resources

204

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
• Creating a central data center that manages and links information related to
adaptation, research data, weather research, forecasting information (WRF-ARW model),
and relevant information between fields, such as information on agriculture and water
for effective management

6.1.3 Enabling Environment
A proper enabling environment is a core foundation for efficient and effective
climate actions. Climate Change Master Plan 2015-2050 seeks to strengthen enabling
environment in 4 main areas, comprising 1) research and development in data and
technology for climate, 2) development of legislations, economic instruments, financial
mechanisms, and technical tools to support climate actions, 3) capacity building for
relevant stakeholders and raising climate ethic and awareness for all, 4) development of
Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
systems to enhance the transparency of climate action implementation in all levels.
Constraints and gaps
For building a suitable enabling environment for climate actions, Thailand still requires
the followings: establishing financial mechanisms to support climate actions and
technology development, strengthening mechanisms for sectoral and subnational agencies
to integrate adaptation and mitigation measures into their respective planning processes,
setting national monitoring and evaluation system of climate-related policies, enhancing
formal and non-formal education and training programs to improve knowledge and
awareness of teachers, educators, students, stakeholders, and the general public on climate
change at all levels, and developing networking for climate research and information.
Support Needed
Aligning with the LT-LEDS, Thailand primarily needs the support for:
1. Policy Implementation:
• Building capacity in the public and private sectors to integrate climate actions
into their respective plans or enterprises
• Raising awareness of climate change, Thailand’s LT-LEDS and NDCs among
relevant stakeholders and the general public
2. Mechanism and instruments:
• Financial instruments, incentives, mechanisms, and approaches to engage
the private sector in the shift to green investment
• Sharing knowledge and best practices on legal frameworks and modalities to
support Thailand’s LT-LEDS and NDC implementation
The overall support needed for enabling the environment is presented in Table 6-3:

6.2 International Support Received
Thailand has received support from various international partners, which enables
the country to overcome some constraints, gaps, and barriers to climate action. We take
this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation for all support. To further
enhance Thailand's effective implementation of mitigation, adaptation, and climateresilient actions toward the goal of the Paris Agreement, adequate means of support in
terms of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building are still needed, as described
in the previous section.
This section summarizes key messages and provides an overview of the support received
by Thailand, excluding global and regional supporting projects, during the years 2018
and 2021. The formal support received prior to 2018 can be found in the Third National
Communication (NC3) and Third Biennial Update Report (BUR3). The support received
was categorized into three main areas: mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment.
6.2.1 Support Received for Preparing National Communication (NC) and Biennial
Update Report (BUR)
Thailand, as a signatory to the UNFCCC, received financial support from the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) to compile and publish Thailand's Fourth National
Communication (NC4) and Third Biennial Update Report (BUR3) to the UNFCCC.
The preparation was supported by GEF funding of 852,000 USD and in-kind support from
the Thai Government of 700,000 USD. The United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) has been an implementing entity responsible for managing these funds for the GEF.
6.2.2 Support Received from International Donors
Thailand has received support from various multilateral and bilateral partners to facilitate
climate actions in mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment.
Global Environment Facility (GEF)
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided Thailand with financial, technical,
and capacity-building supports through various programs. From GEF-6 and GEF-7,
Thailand received support for climate change activities in 6 key projects with a GEF project
grant of around 24 million USD and Thailand's co-financing of around 250 million USD,
excluding the support on the NC and BUR preparation. Key programs supported by GEF
include the Sixth Operational Phase of the GEF Small Grants Programme in Thailand,
Inclusive Sustainable Rice Landscapes in Thailand, accelerating the adoption and life-cycle
solutions to electric mobility in Thailand, accelerating construction of energy-efficient
green housing units in Thailand, and strengthening Thailand's institutional and technical
capacities. Furthermore, GEF has provided grant funding through UNDP to assist Thailand
in the preparation of its NC and BUR, as described previously.

208

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Green Climate Fund (GCF)
Thailand has received several readiness activities supported through GCF's Readiness and
Preparatory Support Programme (GCF's Readiness Programme). Key activities include
1) increasing resilience to climate change impacts in marine and coastal areas along
the Gulf of Thailand and 2) strengthening the capacities of the Environmental Fund
Division to act as a national climate funding mechanism. Beyond the readiness support,
Thailand received support for the project "Enhancing Climate Resilience in Thailand
through Effective Water Management and Sustainable Agriculture." The project aims to
mitigate climate change's social and economic impacts in the Yom and Nan River basins.
Multilateral Partners
Major multilateral partners include United Nations entities such as United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). United Nations partners
play a crucial role in assisting Thailand to access the UNFCCC climate funds mentioned
above. Multilateral partners also include financial institutions and organizations, such as
the World Bank and World Meteorological Organization.
United Nations
United Nations entities have focused on assisting Thailand in implementing the mitigation
and adaptation measures as well as strengthening its institutional and policy frameworks,
both of which are crucial to facilitating the country's efforts to achieve national climate
targets. As reported in the TBUR, Thailand's Office of Natural Resources and Environmental
Policy and Planning (ONEP), together with UNDP, has implemented a project, "NDC
Support Delivering Sustainability through Climate Finance Actions in Thailand," to
support Thailand in making progress on its NDCs through the development of financing
frameworks for climate action.
Since 2019, more UNDP-led projects have been implemented: programme framework
of support in response to Thailand's development challenges and in supporting
the achievement of the SDGs, increasing resilience to climate change impacts in
marine and coastal areas along the Gulf of Thailand, sixth operational phase of the GEF
small grants programme in Thailand, sustainable mangrove management and coastal
ecosystem development in Phetchaburi province, achieving low carbon growth in cities
through sustainable urban systems management in Thailand, tillage and organic fertilizer
production to prevent GHGs in the northern agricultural areas, and enhancing climate
resilience in Thailand through effective water management and sustainable agriculture.
In addition, UNEP has provided support for the following projects: accelerating construction
of energy-efficient green housing units in Thailand, assessing carbon stock change in a
stratum (Carbon Fluxes) in Thailand, Mekong EbA South: enhancing climate resilience
in the Greater Mekong Sub-region through ecosystem-based adaptation in the Context
of South-South cooperation, inclusive sustainable rice landscapes in Thailand, and the
Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT). UNIDO has supported Thailand
in implementing the programs of accelerating the adoption and life-cycle solutions to
electric mobility development in Thailand and the establishment of Learning Center and
209

CHAPTER 6
Extension of Complete Green Energy Station, Kanchanaburi. Likewise, UNESCO has led
the project on groundwater resources in the Greater Mekong Subregion, which is the
collaborative management to increase resilience to climate change.
The World Bank
The World Bank has been a notable partner to Thailand for decades, and it has supported
Thailand in two significant projects. The first project is the HCFC phase-out management
plan: stage II. The project development objective is to reduce HCFC consumption in
Thailand. By phasing out HCFC, Thailand will contribute to GHG reduction under the
UNFCCC and fulfill the 2020 HCFC consumption phase-out obligations of the Montreal
Protocol, its Multilateral Fund, and the initial requirements of the Kigali Amendment. The
second project is Thailand Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP), which has established
the compulsory components for future implementation of REDD+ mechanism in the
country. REDD+ is an international mechanism to support mitigation measures to reduce
GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhance carbon stock
from forest conservation, sustainable forest management, and reforestation. Thailand
has actively participated in the REDD+ readiness preparation program supported by
the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). Policy related to REDD+ implementation
was also acknowledged in the draft 13th National Economic and Social Development
Plan (2022-2026). In addition, National strategies and action plans for REDD+
were developed in 2021 to increase carbon sequestration and ecosystem services in
natural forests with social and environmental stability and equitable benefit sharing. The
Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation is the key organization
implementing REDD+. The latest six-year action plan (2016-2021) focused on conserving
and restoring degraded forests in watershed areas and preserving biodiversity using
community participation processes based on ecological restoration that support REDD+
measures and the national REDD+ strategy plan.
Bilateral Partners
Germany

210

The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear
Safety (BMU), through its funding instrument, the International Climate Initiative (IKI), has
provided support to Thailand for many climate-related projects. The key projects include
the Sustainable and Climate-Friendly Palm Oil Production and Procurement Project,
climate and environmentally friendly agricultural waste management, Low Carbon Cities
Programme (LCCP) through the cancellation of TVERs, Integrated Waste Management
for GHG Reduction, and Climate Action Programme for the Chemical Industry (CAPCI).
In addition, BMU established Nitric Acid Climate Action Group (NACAG) to support
the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) in developing countries' production processes by
providing technical and financial support to improve production technology, as well
as training relevant officials. In 2021, Thailand signed the Statement of Undertaking
(SOU) to formally join the NACAG group. Under NACAG, BMU by the GIZ will provide
support for Thailand in the following areas: 1) policy and strategic consultation on nitrous
oxide emission requirements, 2) technical support for reducing nitrous oxide, 3) financial
support for Thailand's nitric acid industry, 4) capacity building to monitor and report nitrous
oxide emissions and 5) support for reporting greenhouse gas emissions under the NDC.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Sweden
The government of Sweden, through the Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency and its Challenge Funds, has provided support to Thailand for two key projects:
1) Investment and Financial Flows Assessment (I&FF) Transport Sector under NDC
Support Project: Delivering Sustainability through Climate Finance Actions in Thailand, and
2) Climate Change Financing Framework: CCFF under the NDC Support Project:
Delivering Sustainability through Climate Finance Actions in Thailand.
Australia
The government of Australia, by the Australian Water Partnership, supports a new
initiative as part of its Australia-Mekong Water Facility to identify, evaluate and realize
the benefits associated with Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for integrated urban flood
management in the Mekong region. This "Project on Valuing the Benefits of Nature-based
Solutions for Integrated Urban Flood Management" is implemented in Thailand with
the objectives of supporting economic analysis for selecting suitable Nature-based
solutions for solving urban flooding caused by climate change and strengthening
the capacity of using economic assessment tools through case studies in 2 places in
Thailand, namely Bangkok and Rayong Municipality.
The European Union
The European Union has supported Thailand to become more resilient to climate change
and enhance its sustainable development goals. The key projects are 1) Strengthening
urban climate governance for inclusive, resilient, and sustainable societies in Thailand
(SUCCESS) aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of local urban communities through
improved urban climate governance, state-of-the-art knowledge, and shared learning
and strengthen local institutional mechanisms and practices for inclusive, climate-resilient
and sustainable urban development, 2) Climate-resilient Agriculture for Disaster Risk
Reduction (CRADR), a collaborated project between Disaster Mitigation Working Group
(DMWG) and Agriculture Working Group (AgWG), under the Asia-Pacific Advanced or
APAN network which linked between members of research agencies and educational
institutions from all over the world.
The project aims to study climate change's effects on agriculture in a small-scale
case study (Phrae Province). It also seeks to have modern technologies transferred by
"Partners" from various countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and India to solve the climateresilient problems and develop this project into "Smart Agriculture." Moreover,
the project will be participated by and shared among ASEAN members so that each
country can study and adopt the outcome of this project to deploy in their own country.
Japan
After establishing the Asia-Pacific Adaptation Information Platform (AP-PLAT) to share
regional climate change risk information via an online network, the Ministry of Environment
of Japan (MOEJ) signed the Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) with Thailand on 17
May 2018 to support the "Cooperation for Development of Information Infrastructure
211

CHAPTER 6
for Climate Change Adaptation in Thailand." The Thailand Climate Change Adaptation
Information Platform (T-PLAT) aims to 1) create a platform providing information on climate
risks and adaptation in Thailand and 2) link data on climate change adaptation with
regional platforms (AP-PLAT projects) and support the data dissemination in Southeast
Asia. MOEJ assigned the Overseas Environmental Cooperation Center, Japan (OECC),
in partnership with Green Pacific Co., Ltd., as a project consultant working with ONEP
and DEQP to implement the project. With technical support from Japan, Thailand has
successfully installed the T-PLAT website and presented information in a comprehensive
infographic format.
6.2.3 Support Received by Sector
Categorizing by sector, Thailand has received support for 18 mitigation projects with
a total amount of 31,438,771 USD, 10 adaptation projects with a total amount of 48,667,056
USD, and 6 enabling environment projects with a total amount of 3,419,548 USD. Thailand
has received the most support in climate change mitigation by the number of projects
and climate change adaptation by the amount of support received. The number of
enabling environment projects is slightly less than adaptation, but the amount of
support received is much lower. Considering the small amount of supports received for
climate adaptation reported in the BUR3, more support has been provided to Thailand
for this sector. However, more financial support is needed to strengthen the enabling
environment for climate actions.
The breakdown of information for each sector is detailed in Figure 6-1, providing a bigger
picture of the international support Thailand received.

Figure 6-1: Summary of all support received

Remark:

The chart presents only the amount of support received specifically distributed to Thailand
212

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Mitigation
From the support received for mitigation actions, the IPPU sector received the most
support by the number of projects and amount of funding received. The energy, transport,
and waste sectors received approximately comparable numbers of projects and amounts
of funding. Though the IPPU sector notably contributes to national GHG emissions,
the national priority focuses on the energy and transport sectors as they are the most
significant GHG contributors and the cornerstone for climate mitigation actions.
To align with the energy transition's priority previously described, Thailand still requires
more support for mitigation projects in the energy, transport, waste, agriculture, and
LULUCF sectors to achieve NDC and LT-LEDS targets.
The support received by sector for mitigation actions is summarized in Figure 6-2.

Figure 6-2: Support received for mitigation actions

213

CHAPTER 6
Adaptation
Thailand's support received for adaptation actions concentrates on water management,
human settlement, agriculture, and multi-sector. Water management received the most
support in terms of projects, while human settlement received the most support for
financing amount. However, it is essential to note that the amount of support received
was far lower than support needed by Thailand to minimize risks and vulnerability and
improve the country's resilience.
As a highly vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change, Thailand needs more
support in climate change adaptation, especially in tourism, public health, natural
resources, and agriculture as listed in the support needed section.
The support received by sector for adaptation actions is summarized in Figure 6-3.

Figure 6-3: Support received for adaptation actions

214

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
Enabling Environment
Most support for enhancing the enabling environment of climate actions in Thailand
targets institutional strengthening and mechanisms and instruments. Both received
a comparable amount of funding, but institutional strengthening received more numbers
of projects.
Based on the support needed section, Thailand still requires more support for policy
implementation, mechanism and instruments, networking, awareness-raising, and capacity
building to enable climate actions effectively.
The support received by sector for enhancing the enabling environment is summarized
in Figure 6-4.

Figure 6-4: Support received for enhancing enabling environment

215

CHAPTER 6
6.2.4 Support Received by Type
The support received in climate actions can also be categorized into 4 supporting types:
technology transfer, technical support, capacity building, and financial support (see
Figure 6-5).
It is important to note that most projects detailed in this report involve more than one
type of support. A combination of technical support and capacity building is the most
common type of support that Thailand has received. In addition, Thailand only received
a few projects that provided support in technology development and transfer, which play
important roles in mitigation and adaptation implementation.

THAILAND'S FOURTH NATIONAL COMMUNICATION
6.2.5 Summary of Support Received
While contributing to less than 1% of global emissions, Thailand bears increasingly
significant climate risks of natural disasters and catastrophes. Thus, Thailand has
made substantial efforts to mitigate climate change by implementing GHG emission
reduction measures, enhancing national adaptive capacity to achieve climate resilience,
and strengthening the enabling environment for climate measures implementation.
Nevertheless, these efforts require extensive investment, innovative technology,
institutional integration, and capacity and expertise.
At present, support is needed for Thailand to increase the capacities, resources, and
technology development of governmental agencies, private sectors, and the public
to take climate actions. To enhance Thailand's effective implementation of mitigation,
adaptation, and climate-resilient actions toward the goal of the UNFCCC and Paris
Agreement, the support needed by Thailand and the support provided should be aligned.
From the support received during 2019-2022, there are still some gaps between support
needed and support received. Fulfilling these gaps will ensure that Thailand can expose
its full potential to implement climate actions effectively and efficiently.

The project focuses on GHG reduction in the Transport
sector by addressing the problems concerning the scaling up
of EV utilization in Thailand. It seeks to set out the institutional
framework and EV usage demonstration in the EEC zone.

The I&FF study will draw on historical and current public and
private investment data to create a projection. It is a tool to
support the country's policy planning.

Remark:

The objective is to integrate planning and budgeting for
climate adaptation operations in marine and coastal
areas. This project builds on the adaptation plan currently
being implemented by the Office of Natural Resources and
Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). The project
will focus on marine and coastal areas and local adaptation
planning processes. Resources and assistance from
the Green Climate Fund (GCF) will be used to address
the barriers, data gathering, knowledge, and coordination
for adaptation planning, especially in the private sector. The
expected results are
1. Increasing the capacity and knowledge to apply climate
risk data to the planning and development of regional
marine and coastal areas
2. Increasing the efficiency of the implementation of
the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan and
integration of adaptation in planning and budgeting in
marine and coastal areas
3. Developing financial strategies for climate change
adaptation in marine and coastal areas

The project seeks to enhance Thai agencies' capacity to
approach Green Climate Fund for climate mitigation and
adaptation

The project aims to strengthen the capacity of Thailand's
Environmental Fund Division to be recognized and endorsed
by the Green Climate Fund.

To enhance the capacity of local communities to adopt
climate mitigation measures

The project is to develop a plan/policy for integrating genderinclusive factors in budget management and planning of
climate change measures. Several activities were initiated,
such as target training sessions for agencies, operational
meetings, and a handbook on climate finance.
