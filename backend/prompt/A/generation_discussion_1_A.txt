You will receive a document and a set of existing top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify clear, generalizable, and classification-driven discussion points from the document. These discussion points should explicitly highlight meaningful differences, suitable for comparative analysis, and must be general enough to accommodate future subtopics or detailed exploration.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Carefully analyze the provided document to identify clearly relevant, generalizable, and comparative discussion points suitable for classification-driven analysis.

Discussion points must represent single, broad categories explicitly suited for highlighting meaningful differences.

Discussion points must be general enough to support future subtopics.

New discussion points must include:

A topic level number

A concise and clear discussion point label


Step 2: Choose exactly ONE of these actions:

If an existing top-level discussion point clearly matches the document's content, return only that existing point.

If the document contains relevant content not covered by the provided points, clearly add the new discussion point(s) with appropriate labeling.
