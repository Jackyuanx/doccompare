  "The international collaboration, with public recognition and awareness of climate change, has significantly increased since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, which is in accordance with the IPCC comprehensive assessment reports on climate change.",
  "In particular, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) revealed the wide-spread and severe climate impacts in the near term, escalating risk from higher temperatures causing irreversible climate change impacts, and increased vulnerability to climate risks due to inequality and development challenges, all of which indicate that the world needs urgent mitigation and adaptation actions to address loss and damages.",
  "Thus, a monumental step was made at COP26 when all member states came together with the ambitious decision to put their best efforts into limiting the average temperature increase to less than 1.5°C.",
  "To achieve this goal, global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions must be pursued by 2050.",
  "Thailand recognizes the severe impacts of climate change and the significance of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement.",
  "At COP26 World Leaders Summit, Thailand announced the country’s new ambitious targets to reach carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and 2065, respectively, and increase NDC contributions up to 40% upon timely and adequate international support on finance, technology transfer, and capacity building.",
  "In terms of actions, Thailand has mainstreamed climate change agenda into its national plans: the 20-Year National Strategy, National Economic and Social Development Plans, Climate Change Master Plan, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA), and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).",
  "Furthermore, the Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) and the 2nd updated NDC were revised and submitted to UNFCCC by COP27.",
  "The revisions focus on the alignment of mitigation measures and 2050 carbon neutrality and 2065 net-zero GHG emissions, just transition, and optimization of socio-economic impacts.",
  "In the 2nd updated NDC, Thailand elevated the contribution level to 40%, with 30% from our domestic effort and 10% from international support.",
  "This target is challenging for the energy, transport, and agriculture sectors.",
  "The challenge also includes raising awareness and participation from all relevant sectors, particularly the private sector, which urgently needs to adapt and enhance its capacity for business competition to keep pace with the rapidly changing global circumstances and trends.",
  "Thailand’s Fourth National Communication (NC4) has been prepared in accordance with UNFCCC guideline.",
  "The NC4 is a medium for Thailand to communicate its commitment to fulfilling the obligations under Article 4.1 and 12.1 of the UNFCCC.",
  "It presents updated and more comprehensive information on the national circumstances; institutional arrangements; national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory; mitigation policies, plans, and measures; achievement of GHG emissions reduction under NAMA; preparation for the implementation of NDC; vulnerability and adaptation; other information and activities relevant to climate actions; and constraints, gaps, support needed, and support received to implement its adaptation and mitigation actions.",

  "Thailand will continue to put the utmost effort into prioritizing and implementing our policies to combat climate change and limit the increase of global average temperature under the Paris Agreement according to the country’s vision toward net-zero GHG emissions by the second half of this century.",
  "NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES",
  "The physical context reveals the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts as above-average temperatures tend to rise, precipitation has fluctuated over time, population structure is becoming an \"aging society,\" and its long coastal zone faces coastal erosion and sea-level rise.",
  "Thailand relies largely on commercial energy production and consumption, but renewable energy shares have continued to increase.",
  "The country’s natural resources exhibit not only the abundance and absorptive capacity but also the degrading conditions from climate-induced disasters.",
  "As a final point, National Committee on Climate Change Policy (NCCC) serves as a national institute overseeing climate policy development and implementation.",
  "It was initially composed of 5 Subcommittees, but 2 Subcommittees have been recently instituted to advance Thailand’s climate actions—the Subcommittee on the Mobilization of GHG Mitigation with Carbon Sequestration in LULUCF Sector and the Subcommittee on the Mobilization of GHG Mitigation with CCUS Technology Implication.",
  "NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY",
  "The inventory report was prepared using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and presented Thailand’s national GHG emissions from 2000 to 2018 by sources and removals by sinks.",
  "The GHG emissions estimated in this report include both direct and indirect emissions: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2).",
  "The GHG emission is calculated by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory System (TGEIS).",
  "Thailand has made efforts to uphold its commitment under the Convention by integrating climate change mitigation into its national and sectoral policies and plans and implementing mitigating measures in order to achieve the national GHG reduction targets—NAMA’s target to reduce GHG emissions by 7-20% from BAU by 2020 and NDC’s target to reduce GHG emission by 20-25% from BAU by 2030.",
  "Thailand submitted the 2nd updated NDC, which aligns with an ambitious pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 30% from the BAU level by 2030.",
  "Furthermore, Thailand will continue efforts to meet the long-term goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2065.",
  "Thailand implemented NAMA’s mitigation measures and successfully achieved a GHG reduction of 56.54 MtCO2eq in 2020 from 10 mitigation measures in the energy and transport sectors which is 15.40% lower than its BAU level.",
  "As NAMA ended in 2020, Thailand has transitioned toward NDC, which aims to reduce GHG emissions in the energy, transport, industrial process and product use, and waste management sectors.",
  "In addition, Thailand has also increasingly developed supporting measures and voluntary actions to mitigate GHG reduction, such as the carbon market and carbon label schemes.",
  "Thailand, a developing country, is ranked 9th as the most affected country by climate change impacts in the last 20 years (2000-2019) by Global Climate Risk Index 2021 (CRI), both in terms of human impacts (fatalities) and direct economic losses.",
  "Thailand, by ONEP and RU-CORE, has developed a database of geospatial risks from climate change by assessing climate impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities in 6 significant sectors: water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resources management, and human settlement and security.",
  "The risk and vulnerability assessments for climate projection are based on the top-down approach using climate scenarios generated through the most updated version of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and RCP models, which are derived from data in the SEACLID/CORDEX SEA Phase II project.",
  "For all the 6 sectors, 3 types of climate hazards—heat, drought, and flooding—are considered together with socio-economic factors.",
  "The vulnerability assessments show that climate impacts are not homogenous across hazard, type, time, and areas.",
  "Different sectors and different regions in Thailand are vulnerable to different climate hazards.",
  "In addition to the physical impacts of climate change, Thailand is also vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions, particularly the aging population.",
  "and empower the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures enabling Thailand to achieve the objectives of the Convention.",
  "The information and activities include technology development and transfer; research and systematic observation; education, training, public awareness, public participation, and public access to climate information; capacity building; and information sharing and networking.",
  "First, Thailand has established a mechanism for technology transfer and formulated a climate technology database and roadmap indicating technologies that require further development aligning with key sectors stated in Thailand's NDC and Thailand's NAP.",
  "Significant technologies have been developed to reach carbon neutrality and net-zero targets in the energy sector, such as technologies related to electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel.",
  "Second, research and systematic observation have been conducted in climate variable sectors: atmospheric, terrestrial (i.e., land and water), and oceanic domains.",
  "Third, Thailand has engaged in implementing capacity-building initiatives as well as Actions for Climate Empowerment (ACE) under Article 6 of the UNFCCC, which involves not only climate knowledge dissemination but also the environmental rights of the public to participate and access climate information.",
  "Finally, ONEP acts as a primary entity for climate information sharing, and Thailand cooperates with international communities at bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels to address climate change issues.",
  "Thailand has received support from various international partners to facilitate climate actions in mitigation, adaptation, and enabling environment, including the preparation of Thailand's Fourth National Communication (NC4) and Third Biennial Update Report (BUR3) to the UNFCCC.",
  "From 2020-2022, Thailand has received support from multilateral and bilateral partners for a total of 34 projects, entailing 18 mitigation projects with a total amount of 31,438,771 USD, 10 adaptation projects with a total amount of 48,667,056 USD, and 6 enabling environment projects with a total amount of 3,419,548 USD.",
  "Most support was a combination of technical support and capacity building.",
  "However, considering remaining constraints and gaps, Thailand still needs international support in terms of finance, technical expertise, technology transfer, and capacity building to ensure the achievement of LT-LEDS in a short-term period (2025-2035), a mid-term period (2040-2050), and a long-term period (2050-2065).",
  "More support is needed, particularly for technology development and transfer, which is essential for mitigation and adaptation implementation.",
  "For mitigation, Thailand needs support for the energy transition toward renewable sources focusing on renewable energy technologies (such as solar and wind), enhancing the potential use of Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) & Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies, and developing other technologies to achieve GHG emission reduction and a net-zero emission.",
  "For adaptation, support is needed for developing a data map showing areas at risk of climate change impacts and accessible viable adaptive technology.",
  "To enhance the enabling environment, Thailand requires support for developing and strengthening mechanisms, instruments, and policy implementation, such as financial instruments and incentives to engage private sectors in green investment and capacity building for all stakeholders to integrate climate actions into their respective practice and plans.",
  "Its long coastal zone of 24 provinces with a total area of 101,678 km2, a total coastal length of 3,151 km, and an approximately 20 million population are among the most vulnerable to climate risks, particularly coastal erosion.",
  "The devastating climate change crisis leads to substantial social and economic loss as coastal communities and economic activities, mainly fishery and tourism, are inevitably affected.",
  "Bangkok and its perimeter provinces adjoined to the coast and rivers are ranked as one of the top cities in the world at the highest risk of severe flooding resulting from precipitation change, sea-level rise, and coastal erosion under climate change.",
  "In addition, the link between the reported information and Thailand’s implementation for achieving sustainable development is highlighted as sustainable development goals, and climate change actions are complementary and greatly aligned.",
  "The natural resources section exhibits not only the abundance and absorptive capacity of natural resources but also the degrading conditions that occurred from economic activities and climate-induced disasters.",
  "The state of environment section seeks to report environmental quality and management in three sectors: air quality, water quality, and waste management.",
  "The section on national economic and social development sets out the national development objectives, priorities, and outlook as well as the key economic and social sectors vastly affected by and interlinked with climate change—agriculture, tourism, health, poverty and inequality, and gender equality.",
  "As a final point, the chapter illustrates Thailand’s establishment of inter-ministerial committees to oversee climate policy development and implementation and comprehensive national systems to monitor, evaluate, and report on progress.",
  "Two more subcommittees on carbon sequestration and CCUS have been instituted in the institutional arrangement to advance Thailand’s climate actions.",
  "These implementations also serve as progress relating to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3)—Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.",
  "Thailand's climate is influenced by two main seasonal monsoon winds: the southwest monsoon and the northeast monsoon.",
  "The southwest monsoon starts in May and brings a stream of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean toward Thailand, causing abundant rain over the country, especially on the windward side of the mountains.",
  "The northeast monsoon starts in October and brings cold, dry air from the anticyclone in the Chinese mainland over major parts of Thailand, mainly focused on the north and northeast regions.",
  "Based on the Thai Meteorological Department’s climate change reports, the variation of precipitation and the number of rainy days has oscillated over time.",
  "In the last 7 years (2015-2021), the rainfall variation has fluctuated, with the lowest rainfall in 40 years in 2019 (1,343.4 mm) since 1979 (1,332.3 mm).",

  "13. The GHG emissions are estimated from the Energy, IPPU, Agriculture, LULUCF, and Waste sectors which include both direct and indirect emissions.",
  "14. Direct GHGs consist of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) whereas indirect GHGs consist of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2).",
  "18. Net GHG emissions therefore increased overall from 200,455.96 GgCO2eq in 2000 to 286,680.47 GgCO2eq in 2018, with an average annual increase of 2.01% (Table 2-4, Figure 2-1).",
  "19. Between 2000-2018, the main source of GHG emissions was the Energy sector, which saw an increase of 55.88% from 165,092.40 GgCO2eq in 2000 to 257,340.89 GgCO2eq in 2018.",
  "20. The proportion of GHG emissions in the Energy sector accounted for 67.14% of total emission sources in 2000, increasing to comprise 69.06% of total emission sources in 2018.",
  "21. In the same period, the share of emissions from the Agriculture sector decreased from 19.95% in 2000 to 15.69% in 2018, the IPPU sector increased from 8.65% in 2000 to 10.77% in 2018 and the shares of emissions from the Waste sectors slightly increased from 4.26% in 2000 to 4.48% in 2018.",

  "31. 2.3.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018 Total direct GHG emissions from the Energy sector in 2018 were estimated to be 257,340.89 GgCO2eq.",
  "32. The majority of GHG emissions in the Energy sector were generated by fuel combustion, consisting mostly of 1A1 Energy industries at around 103,055.20 GgCO2eq (40.05%).",
  "33. GHG emissions from Transport, Manufacturing Industries and Construction, and other sectors were 75,029.65 GgCO2eq (29.16%), 52,078.20 GgCO2eq (20.24%), and 16,884.56 GgCO2eq (6.56%).",
  "38. 2.3.2.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018 Total direct GHG emissions from the IPPU sector in 2018 were estimated at 40,118.18 GgCO2eq.",
  "39. The majority of GHG emissions in the IPPU sector were generated by the Mineral Industry (2A) at around 20,574.46 GgCO2eq (51.28%), mainly consisting of Cement Production at around 19,361.06 GgCO2eq.",
  "44. GHG estimations were calculated for 2 sub-categories, including 3A Livestock (3A1 Enteric fermentation and 3A2 Manure management) and 3C Aggregate sources and non-CO2 emission sources on land (3C1b Biomass burning (Cropland), 3C2 Liming, 3C3 Urea fertilization, 3C4 Direct N2O emissions from managed soils, 3C5 Indirect N2O emissions from managed soils, 3C6 Indirect N2O emissions from manure management, and 3C7 Rice cultivation).",
  "48. 2.3.3.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018 Total GHG emissions from the Agriculture Sector in 2018 were 58,486.02 GgCO2eq.",
  "49. Livestock contributed 13,115.64 GgCO2eq (22.43%), comprising 10,052.24 GgCO2eq from enteric fermentation, 2,494.12 and 569.27 GgCO2eq for direct and indirect manure management, respectively.",
  "50. Meanwhile, crop related-GHG emissions accounted for 45,370.38 GgCO2eq (77.57%).",
  "2.3.4 Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) 2.3.4.1 Methodology All methodologies and tools used to report GHG inventories for Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) were consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006), Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2003), and Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2000).",
  "The 2006 IPCC Guidelines define six land-use categories: forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other lands.",
  "GHG emissions/removals from the LULUCF sector during 2000-2018 were estimated for the three land categories (excluding grassland, wetlands, and settlements).",
  "The Tier 2 methodology was used primarily wherever activity data and country-specific emission factors were available.",
  "Approach 1 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was adopted for representing land-use areas of which total land-use areas in each stratification were reported without data on conversions between land uses.",
  "2.3.4.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2018 The total CO2 emissions/removals from C stock changes for each land use category is the sum of those from these all sub-categories taking into account the three carbon pools: (i) above-ground biomass, (ii) below-ground biomass, and (iii) dead organic matter (deadwood and litter).",
  "The LULUCF sector in Thailand showed a trend of increased net removals because the total removals exceeded the total emissions.",
  "LULUCF activities contributed to a tremendous increase in net removal from the atmosphere since 2000 due to the net removal of rubber plantations.",
  "It can be observed that cropland dominates the net removals estimated for the LULUCF sector for Thailand.",
  "The net removals in the period of 2000 –2014 fluctuated due to the net removals from cropland and emissions from land conversion, but it seemed stable after 2015.",
  "In 2018, the LULUCF sector contributed to a net removal of 85,968.30 GgCO2eq, accounting for an increase by two folds compared with the year 2000.",
  "The net removal estimated for cropland remaining cropland was 68,806.14 GgCO2eq, accounting for almost 80% of the overall net removals of the LULUCF sector.",
  "The forest land conversion emitted 9,502.20 and 119.46 GgCO2eq from land converted to cropland and other lands, respectively, thereby decreasing about 60% compared with the emissions in 2000.",
  "While non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in the LULUCF sector emitted 19.52 GgCO2eq.",
  "Details of GHG emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector by gas type and source in 2018 are presented in Figure 2-7 and Table 2-9.",
  "In the LULUCF sector, non-CO2 emissions were estimated from biomass burning from an uncontrolled forest fire in natural forest (3B1a Forest Land Remaining Forest Land) and forest converted to cropland (3B2b Land Converted to Cropland) and to other lands (3B6b Land Converted to other lands) in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",
  "This may be important for strengthening institutions' capacity in data collection, quality control of data, and enhancing mitigation measures.",
  "Although the MRV systems for the LULUCF sector have been developed and implemented among the relevant stakeholders, activity data relevant to forest land remains incomplete because forest areas in the LULUCF sector involve multiple departments (i.e., Royal Forest Department and Forest Industry Organization).",
  "To provide more accurate GHG estimation and adopt the higher IPCC methodologies, remote sensing-based monitoring of land use and land cover is needed to classify types of natural forests and forest plantations, monitor their changes, and detect forest area burning.",
  "Thus, an approach must be developed for the government and private sector to enhance the MRV systems of essential activity data for the LULUCF sector.",
  "MITIGATION MEASURES",
  "Thailand has put all efforts within its capacity to uphold its commitment under the Convention by integrating climate change mitigation into its national and sectoral policies and plans and implementing mitigating measures to achieve the national GHG reduction targets—NAMA’s target to reduce GHG emission by 7-20% from BAU by 2020 and NDC’s target to reduce GHG emission by 20-25% from BAU by 2030.",

Thailand sets long-term targets and guidelines for GHG reduction toward carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero emission in 2065 by identifying key measures in the sectors of energy, transport, IPPU, waste, agriculture, and LULUCF, which is the GHG removal sector of the country, for relevant agencies and sectors to use as operational guidelines.",
  "20. ONEP revised and updated LT-LEDS and NDC with support from the Deutsche Gesellshaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH to study, improve, and formulate a long-term strategy for the country’s low emissions development and set GHG reduction targets under the NDC consistent with the Prime Minister’s statement at the COP26 meeting.",
  "23. It was developed by using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model (AIMEnduse) to project the long-term low-level greenhouse gas emissions, including remedial policy measures for climate change adaptation action, and using a computable general equilibrium (AIM/ CGE) model to assess the economic and environmental impacts of energy policy and others in the development of LT-LEDS.",
  "44. The BCG Model is a strategy to develop the national economy by balancing economic growth and natural resource sustainability.",
  "Acknowledging that plastic waste and the climate change problems are intertwined, Thailand has formulated the Plastic Waste Management Roadmap 2018-2030 to move toward sustainable plastic management based on the principle of Circular Economy, seeking to serve as a framework and direction for preventing and solving the plastic waste problem in the country.",
  "The roadmap’s underlying principles include Circular Economy, Responsible Production and Consumption, Public-Private Partnership, and Life Cycle Approach.",
  "Guidelines for operation under the roadmap are divided into 3 measures: 1) Measures to reduce the generation of plastic waste at the source, 2) Measures to reduce the use of single-use plastic (Single-use Plastic) in the process of consumption, and 3) Measures to manage the plastic waste after consumption by supporting and encouraging them to be reused.",
  "The roadmap also defines the roles, duties, and responsibilities of relevant agencies in the implementation of the draft Roadmap in all sectors.",
  "It further defines various mechanisms for the Roadmap mobilization, such as enhancing knowledge and understanding with relevant agencies, people, and consumers in order to develop integrated cooperation for the operation and public relations campaign through social media.",
  "There will be studies and target setting on recycled plastics and plastic waste that cannot be recycled to be disposed of properly.",
  "In 2021, Bangkok Metropolitan Administrator (BMA) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) developed the draft Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2021-2030.",
  "The Master Plan aims to align with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in terms of both the policy and the implementation timeframe.",
  "It will significantly contribute to Bangkok's long term vision to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.",
  "The plan outlines the development of key measures for GHG reduction and climate change adaptation, including institutional structures, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems.",
  "Bangkok intends to achieve the GHG emission reduction target and the response to climate change by setting the target and the commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by 19% compared to the BAU from the base year of 2018 by 2030 and to have the long-term goal under the vision to continually reduce greenhouse gases toward a “net-zero emission city” by 2050.",
  "The mitigation measures of GHG reduction under this master plan cover 4 sectors: transport, energy, waste and wastewater, and green urban planning.",
  "Green urban planning is the sector that does not directly reduce GHG emissions but helps to absorb GHGs in the atmosphere.",
  "Thailand proclaimed its Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) to reduce national GHG emissions from the energy and transport sectors compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) by stating that Thailand had the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 7-20 % by 2020.",
  "After the target was set, Thailand developed a system to monitor and assess the amount of GHGs reduction from domestic measures, especially measures on energy and transport.",
  "Thailand has implemented monitoring and evaluation of GHG reductions as follows: 1) A GHG reduction reporting structure was established according to the Domestic MRV structure approved by the National Committee on Climate Change Policy, as illustrated in Chapter 1.",
  "The formation of the NAMA mitigation roadmap for the energy and transport sectors in line with the existing plans of government agencies contributed to the success of respective mitigation measures.",
  "The development of a domestic MRV system to track progress toward NAMA targets involved the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Transport, as well as strong cooperation from other stakeholders in the public and private sectors.",
  "Apart from national efforts to achieve NAMA’s target, Thailand received international support in two key projects to reduce GHG emissions: RAC NAMA.",
  "RAC NAMA project, or Thailand Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action, is commissioned by the NAMA Facility on behalf of the German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety and the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and implemented by GIZ with support from Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) and Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP).",
  "Thai Rice NAMA is a cooperative project between MOAC and GIZ, funded by NAMA Facility.",
  "This project, implemented from 2018 to 2023, promotes converting traditional to sustainable rice cultivation or GAP++ by adopting Alternative wetting and drying (AWD), site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), and crop residue management.",
  "The project targets is 100,000 farmer households in Thailand’s Central plain area (6 provinces).",
  "GHG emission reduction: It targets GHG reduction of 1.7 million tCO2eq. in a 5-year period (2018-2023).",
  "Technology transfer: Emission reduction technologies were transferred to and widely adopted by farmers consisting of Alternative wetting and drying (AWD), Laser Land Leveling, site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), and crop residue management.",
  "Policy and management: The Sustainable Rice Platform National Chapter was established as a forum to engage all stakeholders in developing Thai GAP++ (Sustainable rice standard).",
  "The standard promotes rice cultivation method that is internationally recognized as contributing to climate mitigation and adaptation.",
  "Technical and capacity building: Series of training on sustainable rice cultivation were provided for 295 officials from the Rice Department (RD) and Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE) and 13,220 farmers, the entire rice fields of approximately 63,450 ha.",
  "From implementing the Thai Rice NAMA project, the RD, BAAC, and GIZ considered that sustainable rice cultivation benefited Thailand’s economic, social, and environmental development and enhanced the farmers’ standard of living.",
  "The relevant agencies continue to scale up and expand the project implementation to other provincial parts of Thailand.",
  "As an Accredited Entity, GIZ held a discussion session with the ONEP and BAAC to develop a concept note for strengthening Climate Smart Rice Farming and submit this concept project to Green Climate Fund: GCF in 2021.",
  "Another extension from the Thai Rice NAMA is the project of Strengthening Climate-Smart Rice Value Chains, aiming to improve the capacity of rice farmers and service providers on climate mitigation and adaption technology.",
  "The project will be developed through a rice cultivation paradigm shift, rice value chain generation, and private sector participation.",
  "Thailand has established the MRV system to track progress on climate mitigation measures under the NDC Roadmap 2021-2030.",
  "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries.",
  "Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one ton of CO2, which can be counted toward meeting Kyoto targets.",
  "Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO), as Designated National Authority of CDM, has issued Letter of Approval to 222 projects.",
  "In addition, Thailand has 70 CDM projects certified for greenhouse gases (issued CERs) with 15.03 million tCO2eq.",
  "The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is a bilateral mechanism initiated by Japan to help Thailand adopt low-carbon technology for greenhouse gas reduction projects with financial support from the Japanese government.",
  "Greenhouse gas reduction projects require measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) to ensure reliable reduction in greenhouse gases.",
  "The Joint Committee endorses the methodology used to calculate the amount of greenhouse gases that can be reduced.",
  "Certified reductions in greenhouse gases can be used to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
  "The Low Emission Support Scheme, also known as the LESS project, aims to raise awareness of greenhouse gas emission reduction and support the operators of greenhouse gas reduction activities by providing them a letter of recognition (LOR).",
  "The benefits of LESS implementation include: Showing Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSR) through the implementation of greenhouse gas reduction activities Creating opportunities for the communities to receive funding, technology, and potential development support in conducting greenhouse gas reduction activities Contributing to job creation and revenue from activities that reduce greenhouse gases Supporting the development of greenhouse gas reduction technology in the country Restoring and maintaining the ecological balance of natural resources and the environment Raising awareness for organizations, agencies, and communities to contribute to greenhouse gas reduction and conduct environmentally friendly activities",
  "Thailand has established guidelines on the trading and use of carbon credits for domestic and international purposes.",
  "Recognizing global awareness of climate change and GHG emissions reduction, as well as the guidelines under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO) has developed an internationally equivalent standard of Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program or T-VER as an alternative for project developers to use and trade internationally recognized carbon credits.",
  "T-VER mechanism promotes and supports all sectors to voluntarily participate in GHG emission reduction.",
  "The T-VER carbon credits are developed in compliance with the requirements of the GHG reduction mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement and the international voluntary GHG reduction mechanism implemented by non-governmental organizations such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard (GS).",
  "The benefits of T-VER include: • Carbon Credits can be used for CSR purposes and voluntary carbon offsets for companies. • Encouraging the development of GHG emission reduction projects with co-benefits by means of certifying carbon credits • Promoting Voluntary Carbon Market in Thailand • Raising perception /awareness of climate change and encouraging public and private sector involvement • Preparing all stakeholders for the future new agreement on Global GHG emission reduction From 2014-2021, 257 projects have been registered as T-VER projects with the expected GHG emissions reduction potential of 9,582,052 tCO2eq per year.",
  "In 2013, Thailand launched the Thailand Carbon Offsetting Program (T-COP).",
  "Each participant (i.e., individuals, organizations, products & services, and events) can voluntarily offset their GHG emissions in this offsetting carbon program.",
  "It provides a platform for a participant to offset its carbon footprint by contributing money to retire the certified carbon credits, particularly the domestic carbon credits from (T-VER).",
  "This has created a voluntary carbon market in Thailand with a transaction volume of around 286,000 tCO2eq at the average price of carbon credits around 34 THB/tCO 2eq.",
  "Thailand’s carbon market is a small voluntary market with an average growth rate of 8.5% per annum, with most carbon credit trading within Thailand in the form of negotiations. (Over-theCounter: OTC) the price of carbon credits is between 15-200 THB/ tCO2eq.",
  "From 2013-2021, overall participants are 112 companies with 690,678 tCO2eq carbon credits, 46 products with 3,471 tCO2eq carbon credits, 107 events with 15,523 tCO2eq carbon credits, and 1,265 individuals with 5,817 tCO2eq carbon credits.",
  "Corporate Carbon Footprint for Organization (Corporate Carbon Footprint: CCF) is a method for displaying the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from corporate operations.",
  "Manage to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the factory, industrial and national levels.",
  "Currently, TGO has created a project to promote the organization’s carbon footprint in the industrial sector and local government.",
  "CCF shows the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by corporate activities such as fuel combustion, electricity consumption, waste management, and transportation.",
  "It can be used to drive the organization’s management of greenhouse gas emission reduction.",
  "TGO initiated the Carbon Footprint of Products promotion project to raise consumer awareness and disseminate Carbon Footprint (CFP) labeling information from the production process through the products in the market.",
  "The CFP label attached to the products shows consumers how much greenhouse gases are emitted throughout the products’ life cycle from acquiring raw materials, production processes, distribution, use, and waste management after expiration of use, which helps to make consumers’ decisions.",
  "The scheme aims to induce manufacturers to adopt mitigation measures and reduce GHG production with consumers’ purchase power.",
  "Furthermore, this CFP can be used by business partners through their supply chain; the buyers can request CF information of purchased raw materials from suppliers to quantify their CFP through their products’ life cycle.",
  "Thus, the final manufacturers can disclose their CFP on products to express their awareness of global warming and climate change.",
  "This effort can also increase the competitiveness of Thai producers in the global market, where the concern on the importance of global warming and climate change is continually increasing.",
  "TGO, in collaboration with the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), developed requirements and guidelines for quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Products.",
  "The guidelines aim to disseminate a standardized approach to Thai producers to quantify their CFP.",
  "TGO has developed the CFP certification and registration scheme for Thai producers in accordance with ISO 14067: 2018 Greenhouse gases – Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification and developed a third-party verification system to increase the credibility and reliability of the Thai CFP scheme to meet the International Standardization.",
  "Producers who intend to quantify their CFP shall comply with the assigned Product Category Rule (PCR) and the requirements and guidelines for quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Products.",
  "Carbon Footprint Reduction Label (CFR) or Global Warming Reduction Label is a label that demonstrates a certified Carbon Footprint of Product (CFP) and its emissions reduction based on the TGO eligible reduction criteria.",
  "The CFR evaluation process includes the quantification and certification of the base year and current year CFP and the comparison results between the base year and current year certified CFP or against its product category benchmarking threshold announced by TGO.",
  "The product registered as CFR shall comply with the following requirements: 1) The certified CFP of its current year compared to the base year certified CFP shall be reduced not less than 2% or 2) The certified CFP of its current year is equal to or less than the product category benchmarking threshold and not more than its base year certified value.",
  "In 2021, 127 products from 28 companies were labeled with an overall emission reduction of 294,055 tCO2.",
  "The department of local governments and TGO collaborated to encourage local governments to report greenhouse gas data in local governments and cities to promote the management of greenhouse gases in local governments to become a carbon reduction politics and as a database for greenhouse gas reduction activities to become a carbon reduction city.",
  "From 2011-2021, a total of 237 municipalities participated in the project, and also expanded the city’s carbon footprint in 2014 to guide the reporting of urban greenhouse gas data as well as for the year 2019, with the cooperation of 94 municipalities, which has been implemented in the city-level greenhouse gas data reporting guidelines and appropriate greenhouse gas reduction plans in each area.",
  "TGO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have joined forces to develop the project “Achieving Low Carbon Growth in Cities through Sustainable Urban System Management in Thailand,” with financial support from the World Environment Fund (Global Environment Fund: GEF) of 3.15 million USD.",
  "The project was launched in 2017 and accomplished in July 2021.",
  "The LCC project was designed as a four-year project to promote low-carbon urban development in mid-sized Thai cities.",
  "It pursues the dual aims of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, economic benefits, and enhancement of the lives of local people through an improved urban environment.",
  "Emphasis is on the waste management, transport, and electricity end-use sectors.",
  "The project cooperates with the four mid-sized Thai cities of Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiang Mai, Samui, and Khon Kaen.",
  "LCC targets three outcomes for its partner cities: (1) low carbon planning, (2) demonstration of low carbon city initiatives, and (3) financing of increased investment in low carbon city initiatives.",
  "For each city, the low carbon planning work features, development of city carbon footprints, and low carbon development strategies are to be incorporated into mainstream planning.",
  "The demo outcome features a package of demos for each city.",
  "Nakhon Ratchasima and Khon Kaen demos cut across all three sectors: waste management, end-use energy/ distributed solar PV, and transport, while Chiang Mai focuses entirely on transport and Samui on organic waste management.",
  "The financing/ investment outcome was intended to develop financing mechanisms for low carbon development, but its design also features capacity building and awareness-raising.",
  "Subsequently, TGO has set up a Bureau for Low Carbon Cities and plans additional city-level outreach, though it aims to address the local level through cooperation with provinces.",
  "TGO also plans to work with the responsible Ministry, MOI, to develop low-carbon KPIs for the city and provincial staff.",
  "To accelerate economic growth in the next 20 years, the Thai government has set a strategy to promote investment, trade, production, and services in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).",
  "The EEC was designated as a sandbox (pilot area) for various economic, social, and environmental development initiatives.",
  "In terms of production, more than 37% of the total factories in Thailand are located in the EEC area.",
  "Thus, this area possesses a high GHG reduction potential and could be developed as a model for low-carbon industrial cities.",
  "In 2018, TGO initiated “Integrating Climate Actions into the Eastern Economic Corridor: Toward Low Carbon Industry Project.” The objectives are 1) to develop a circular economy and low carbon model for the industry in the EEC area (CE-EEC model), 2) to provide recommendations on circular economy for low carbon industry in the EEC area, 3) to conduct a survey on low carbon technologies and encourage industries to self-assess their low carbon industry readiness, and 4) to develop and integrate the circular economy database into GHG Mitigation Information Platform developed by TGO.",
  "During 2019-2020, policy recommendations and action plans during 2021-2030 were developed to promote the low-carbon industry in the EEC area.",
  "Sixty factories from 3 provinces in the EEC area participated and implemented GHG management and emission reduction activities.",
  "Among these factories, 44 factories calculated and reported an organization’s carbon footprint (CFO), 11 factories reported the carbon footprint of a product (CFP), and 7 factories developed T-VER projects.",
  "Thailand Carbon Neutral Network was established to promote cooperation between governments in GHG reduction to create sustainable growth in a climate-friendly society and move toward net-zero GHG emissions aligning with the international community and the Paris Agreement.",
  "The operational objectives include: promote and support organizations in feasibility studies, readiness potential implementation guidelines and announcement of carbon neutral targets at the enterprise level; encourage increased GHG reduction activities; enhance the benefits of sustainable development from greenhouse gas reduction activities and projects; create a platform for exchanging best practices and experience in managing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions between organizations in the network; and promote info sharing/ exchanges between government agencies and private sector organizations in the network.",
  "The risk and vulnerability assessments are based on the top-down approach using climate scenarios generated through the most updated version of the General Circulation Models (GCMs).",
  "After the risks and vulnerabilities assessment, the chapter illustrates the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which has a vision that “Thailand is resilient with adaptive capacity to climate change impacts and move toward sustainable development,” and its priorities and implementation focus on the followings: increasing water security and reducing losses and damage from water-related disasters; maintaining productivity and food security amidst climate change risks and impacts; strengthening the capacity of the tourism sector toward climate-resilience and sustainable development; establishing effective public health systems to manage risks and reduce impacts from climate change; ensuring sustainable management of biodiversity resources to respond to climate change impacts; and enhancing the capacity of individuals, communities, and cities to adapt to climate change impacts appropriately according to the local context.",
  "Nevertheless, certain barriers remain for Thailand to overcome in order to have effective and efficient climate adaptation implementation—limitation of knowledge, lack of continued financial support, lack of central database, lack of national climate information center, and lack of access to adaptation technologies.",
  "Therefore, Thailand requires technical, technology, and financial support in establishing a unified data system and coordination mechanism, monitoring and evaluation system, and financial mechanism for fund mobilization and utilization.",
  "The Climate Change Bill aims to increase the efficiency of climate actions in Thailand, put in place long-term adaptation to climate change, and promote sustainable development.",
  "The Climate Change Bill stipulates that there should be climate projection and the risk and vulnerability assessments.",
  "In addition, the national central climate change database should be developed and accessible to the public so that the data can be used to assess the risks and impacts of climate change.",
  "The National Adaptation Plan will provide guidelines and measures to support adaptation to climate change and reduce the risks of climate change.",
  "7. This widening range in rainfall pattern and amount can present a host of problems in many sectors, especially agriculture and water management.",

  "23. Different types of agricultural products – fisheries, livestock, and crops – are unequally and non-uniformly exposed.",
  "24. In addition, natural resources used in agriculture, particularly soil and water, are also affected by climate change.",
  "25. Examples of impacts of climate change on capture fisheries and aquaculture in Thailand include changes in fish species population as well as changes in quality and quantity of fisheries as health, growth, breeding, and habitat are interrupted.",
  "26. For livestock, there might be interruptions in the health, growth, and breeding of livestock, which in turn affect the quality and quantity of livestock.",
  "27. Climate change might affect crop production during the growing phases as cause post-harvest loss.",
  "28. Climate change might also indirectly impact agricultural production by decreasing soil fertility and water availability.",
  "30. These climate hazards adversely affect outdoor tourism activities, tourism destinations – both man-made attractions and natural attractions – and public and private services, such as traffic infrastructure, tourism facilities, water and energy supply, and waste management.",
  "31. Examples of impacts of climate change on tourism activities and destinations include disruptions of outdoor tourism activities, loss of cultural tourist attractions and amenities, loss of natural characteristics and attractiveness, and reduced diversity of natural resources.",
  "32. Examples of impacts of climate change on public and private services include interruption of the transport system, injuries and loss of life, disruption of public services, and conflicts with local communities over resource uses.",
  "34. In terms of exposure, climate change affects health through diverse channels, including air quality, physical outdoor activity, nutrition quality and quantity, water quality and quantity, sanitation facilities in households and communities, health facilities and medical services, as well as physical security and integrity.",
  "36. Change in vector ecology because of climate change can lead to emerging and re-emerging diseases.",
  "37. Interrupted nutrition and water qualities and quantities can lead to malnutrition and increased spread of germs.",
  "38. In addition, the destroyed or damaged health facilities due to climate change can lead to disruption in medical services.",
  "41. The natural resources that are exposed to these climate hazards can be largely grouped into marine and coastal ecosystems, wetlands, and terrestrial ecosystems.",
  "42. For marine and coastal ecosystems, examples of impacts include loss of coastal and marine species and ecosystems, decreased tourism demand, reduced fisheries productivity, changing livelihood of coastal population, and loss of natural nursery for species.",
  "43. For wetlands, examples of impacts include biodiversity loss, increased extinction of species, and food insecurity.",
  "44. For terrestrial ecosystems, examples of impacts include changing and shifting of habitat and interconnections between ecosystems and disturbing its functions and emerging diseases and their transmission from wildlife to livestock and humans.",
  "46. Considering the exposure in the human settlement and security sectors, population, urban system and services as well as land use characteristics, spatial planning and infrastructure are exposed to the impacts of climate change.",
  "47. Examples of climate change impacts on population include injuries, loss of life and diseases.",
  "48. For the impacts of climate change on urban system and services, climate change can cause interruption of water supply for agriculture, industry and residential area as well as disruption of public services.",
  "Vulnerability is separated into 2 categories, physical/biophysical vulnerability and inherent/social vulnerability.",
  "The former is the potential damage to a system caused by a specific event involving a physical hazard or disaster or climate catastrophe, whereas the latter is the state of the system that exists prior to exposure to danger or danger, which are indices indicating the internal workings of the system and explains the structures that make the society or ecosystem sensitive to external harm or damage.",
  "Their relationship can be summarized as follows: Biophysical vulnerability = f (hazard X social vulnerability) Biophysical vulnerability shares many characteristics with the framework for risk, which is the likelihood of danger or disaster and its consequences.",
  "Risks are calculated as follows: Risk = biophysical vulnerability = probability of hazards X (loss/consequences) The risk maps developed by ONEP and RU-CORE are based on the 2007 IPCC’s definition of vulnerability: “Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes.” By this definition, vulnerabilities are a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.",
  "These risk maps show that impacts and risks of climate change are also uneven and non-homogeneous across regions and time horizons.",
  "As will be shown later, different provinces and regions in Thailand are impacted differently by the risks of flooding, drought, and heat, and the impacts vary over time.",
  "Risks are influenced by climate drivers and non-climate drivers.",
  "Direct and indirect risks were calculated for 6 sectors: water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resource management, and human settlement.",
  "For all the 6 sectors, 3 types of climate hazards are considered: high temperature (heat), drought, and flooding.",
  "Both the climate and non-climate risks were then added together to create the risk index.",
  "Process of risk map development started by adjusting the climate indices from the 25 x 25km grid to show province-level averages.",
  "The heat, drought, and flooding hazard indices were used to calculate the combined hazard index.",
  "Next, non-climate indices were calculated regarding their relationship to each hazard type, namely heat, flooding, and drought.",
  "Lastly, combined risk indices are calculated, which are a product of the heat, flooding, and drought risk indices.",
  "All the risk maps for the 6 sectors and for 3 hazard types are presented in the Appendix.",
  "In each sector, the risk maps for heat, flooding, and drought are presented as well as the overall risk map.",
  "Climate change leads to changes in water availability, disruption of water supply, agricultural harvest failure, disruption of water logistic, damage to infrastructure, as well as conflicts on water use among sectors.",
  "Nevertheless, the impacts of climate change in the water management sector are non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in Thailand as shown in the following risk maps.",
  "In assessing the risks of climate change in the water management sector, 7 categories of non-climate factors were considered: access to water resources, population, physical characteristics, areas at high risk of water-related disasters, socio-economic conditions, agricultural land conditions, and infrastructure.",
  "1. 4.2.5.2 Agriculture and food security sectors The agricultural sector faces many challenges, such as unstable commodity prices and adverse impacts of climate change.",
  "2. Agriculture is closely linked to climate change: on the one hand, agricultural sector emits greenhouse gases, and at the same time, agricultural production is affected by heat, floods, droughts, sea level rise, and other climate-related hazards.",
  "3. As mentioned earlier, fisheries and aquaculture, crops, and livestock are affected differently by climate change.",
  "4. Examples of impacts of climate change on capture fisheries and aquaculture include changes in fish species population as well as changes in the quality and quantity of fisheries.",
  "5. For livestock, the quality and quantity of livestock are affected by climate change.",
  "6. Climate change might affect crop production during the growing phases and cause post-harvest loss.",
  "8. However, impacts of climate change in the agriculture and food security sectors are non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in Thailand, as shown in the following risk maps.",
  "42. 4.2.5.5 Natural resource management sector Thailand has a rich abundance of natural resources, many of which are threatened by climate change.",
  "43. Effects such as temperature fluctuations, changes in precipitation, and sea level rise affect both terrestrial, wetland as well as marine and coastal ecosystems.",
  "44. Climate change affects the terrestrial ecosystems by threatening forests and wetlands.",
  "45. Heat and drought threaten both forests and wetlands, causing loss of settlements, species especially endemic species, and biodiversity.",
  "46. Mangrove forests, beaches, sea grass, and corals, which are parts of the marine and coastal ecosystems, are also threatened by the effects of climate change.",
  "47. For marine and coastal ecosystems, examples of impacts include loss of coastal and marine species and ecosystems, decreased tourism demand, reduced fisheries productivity, changing livelihood of coastal population, and loss of natural nursery for species.",
  "48. For terrestrial ecosystems, examples of impacts include changing and shifting of habitat and interconnections between ecosystems and disturbing its functions and emerging diseases and their transmission from wildlife to livestock and humans.",
  "49. Nevertheless, impacts of climate change in the natural resource management sector are non-homogeneous across regions and provinces in Thailand as shown in the following risk maps.",
  "50. In the natural resource management sector, 8 non-climate factors are used in the assessment, which can be divided into 2 factors for heat, 3 factors for flood and 3 factors for drought.",
  "21. 4.3 Implementation of Adaptation Actions and Plans 4.3.1 Water management sector In the past, most water resource management strategies implemented in Thailand have been concentrated on the structural measures, as well as finding new water reserves and community-based water management.",
  "22. 4.3.1.1 Structural adaptation measures 1.",
  "23. Designating areas as flood detention Certain areas of the country are designated as flood detention, such as Bang Rakam District in Phitsanulok province or Bang Ban District in Ayutthaya province.",
  "24. In Thailand, flood detention areas are conceived as agricultural lands which are intentionally inundated for a short period of time to protect downstream areas from flooding.",
  "25. By storing water in this flood detention areas, flood movement is slowed.",
  "26. Farmers in the basin areas are instructed to shift their crop calendars accordingly and receive some compensation from the Royal Irrigation Department, either in cash or in kind.",
  "27. For in-kind compensation, farmers who shifted their crop calendar are ensured to have water for their cultivation.",
  "28. However, there are currently no laws that determine the level of in-cash compensation.",
  "29. 2.",
  "30. Water diversion tunnels These tunnels connect different drainage basins to drain water from one to another to collect and reserve them.",
  "31. Examples include the Prasae-Khlong Yai project and the Khlong Yai-Dok Krai-Nong Pla Lai project in the Eastern part of Thailand.",
  "32. Water from the Prasae River that is supposed to end up flowing into the sea is diverted and stored in the Nong Pla Lai Reservoir.",
  "33. 3.",
  "34. Solving saltwater intrusion The Khlong Lat Pho Floodgate Project and Bang Pakong Dam are examples of structural measures that help to prevent flood and push saltwater out of the waterways and nearby irrigation systems.",
  "35. However, the latter led to coastal erosion and so was unsuccessful.",
  "36. 4.3.1.2 Non-structural adaptation measures 1.",
  "37. Community water management The Hydro-Informatics Institute (Public Organization) and the local communities jointly drafted water management plans with the goal of creating water reserves for use during the dry season.",
  "38. This enables the community to have income during the dry season, such as by planting crops with low water requirement, and strengthens the community by creating a water management network.",
  "39. At present, there are over a thousand such networks, including notable ones such as the Baan Lim Thong in Buriram province and Baan Sala Din in Pathum Thani province.",
  "40. 2.",
  "41. Establishment of an early warning system The Thai Meteorological Department and the Royal Irrigation Department work together to develop a database, combine data from the National Hydroinformatics Data Center, and develop models for forecasting daily and seasonal rain.",
  "42. However, there needs to be further development for higher spatial resolution, as currently estimates can only be made at the provincial level rather than the district level.",
  "43. 4.3.2 Agriculture and food security sectors Climate change and climate variability have direct impacts on agricultural production.",
  "44. From drought and flooding to saltwater intrusion, which affects increasingly large areas, the impacts on the Thai agricultural sector are worsening; therefore, it is very crucial that the agricultural sector in Thailand adapt to climate change.",
  "45. Adaptation measures in the agricultural sector are categorized into crops, livestock, and fisheries.",
  "46. Crops 1.",
  "47. Improving crop varieties that are resistant to pest or drought-tolerant crops to increase yield and reduce costs of production.",
  "48. Relevant governmental agencies have been developing and testing these new crop varieties to ensure that they can be grown in different environment and growing contexts, as well as promoting marketing for those crops.",
  "49. This includes using crop models, which simulate different areas’ circumstances such as soil quality and type, temperature, and water quality.",
  "Development of biotechnologies for farmers",
  "Improving infrastructure for farmers especially regarding water supply, such as improving irrigation systems to cover a larger area and digging wells.",
  "This enables better water management and testing.",
  "Management of physical environment and water quality that affect coastal fishing For the agriculture and food security sector, the highlighted adaptation measure is under the Thai Rice NAMA project.",
  "In irrigated rice production, flooding of paddy fields leads to significant emissions of methane, which has a global warming potential (GWP) 28 times higher than carbon dioxide according to IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and involves excessive use of water.",
  "The implementation strategies under the Thai Rice NAMA project involves 4 main technologies, i.e., laser land leveling, alternate wetting and drying (AWD), site-specific nutrient management, straw & stubble management) and integrated pest management.",
  "The AWD is a water controlling technique originally developed to save irrigation water use in paddy field (Bouman and Tuong 2001).",
  "Water consumption and methane emission were reported to be effectively reduced (e.g., LaHue et al. 2016).",
  "As water shortage especially in the dry season is common in Thailand, available water for rice field irrigation is becoming limited.",
  "In addition, extreme climatic events, such as drought and shift in rainfall distribution pattern, have been widespread in recent decades and imposed a significant threat to water resources management, especially for rice cultivation in the future (IPCC 2012; Thailand Research Fund (TRF) 2016).",
  "Therefore, the AWD technique helps in mitigating for GHG emissions and increasing water use efficiency in rice cultivation.",
  "23. Box 2: Good Practice for Climate Change Adaptation in Public Health Sector For the public health sector, examples of good practice for climate change adaptation are the development of criteria and mechanism for heat warning as well as the heat warning system at the community level in Thailand.",
  "28. 4.3.5 Natural resources management sector Most natural resource management adaptation measures consist of conservation, restoration, and sustainable utilization, as well as encouraging participation of different sectors related to natural resources, mainly those under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.",
  "29. These include the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, responsible for forests and mangroves in protected areas and national forest reserves, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, responsible for marine and coastal areas, and the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning office, responsible for preserving biodiversity and climate change planning and policies.",

  "41. 4.3.6 Human settlement and security sectors Adaptation to climate change in the human settlement and security sector takes place at 3 main levels, namely individual/household, community, and city-wide.",
  "44. Adaptation at the community level Examples of climate change adaptation at the community level are making a walkway along the riverbank or planning to allocate community areas to accommodate the impacts of climate change.",
  "45. However, adaptation at the community level requires information and mechanisms to support participation, such as financing mechanism to support adaptation action.",
  "46. Thailand has funding systems/funds to support climate change adaptation, such as loan dedicated for post-disaster renovation.",
  "49. Adaptation at the city level As urbanization increases, cities are adapting to cope with the impacts of climate change, such as creating public spaces, green areas, and infrastructure systems such as dams and drainage systems.",
  "50. For the human settlements and security sector, an example of a city in Thailand which has concrete actions on climate change adaptation in human settlement is Udon Thani province (see Box 3).",
  "2. As a result, the need for water is increased as well, coupled with climate pressure.",
  "3. Consequently, Udon Thani faces problems with urban flooding, periods of rain and water shortages, which sometimes lead to conflicts among water users.",
  "4. As a result, urban services such as waterworks, waste disposal and wastewater management are at risk of not being able to support the rapid growth of the city of Udon Thani.",
  "5. In response, Udon Thani has established a data center system to inform decision making by integrating space utilization planning and the design of institutions that can adapt and respond to future climate change risks, including brainstorming with stakeholders from various sectors in the district in city planning.",
  "7. 4.4 National adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, plans, goals, and actions Given that Thailand is among the ten countries most vulnerable to climate risk over the 2000-2019 period, Thailand has put climate change adaptation at the top national agenda.",
  "8. Thailand has formulated the Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050), which is a long-term policy framework to enhance low carbon emission and climate resilient society.",
  "10. The Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050) sets out 3 key strategies including climate change adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation and low carbon development, and enabling environment for climate change management.",
  "11. Under the climate change adaptation strategy, adaptation measures and guidelines for 6 sectors were developed, namely water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resource management, and human settlement and security.",
  "12. To provide clearer guidelines and framework on climate change adaptation, ONEP developed the National Adaptation Plan (NAP).",
  "13. The main objective of the NAP is to provide guidance for mainstreaming climate change adaptation at sectoral and sub-national level as well as guidance for budget allocation to finance climate change adaptation related projects and programs.",
  "15. The vision of the NAP is “Thailand is resilient with adaptive capacity to climate change impacts; and moves toward sustainable development.” The NAP is composed of 3 missions: 1) to build climate-resilient development, by enabling the integration of climate change adaptation guidelines and strategies in all sectors at all levels; 2) to strengthen capacity and awareness of development partners at all levels to implement policies and plans on climate change effectively; and 3) to develop databases, research, knowledge, and technology to support climate change adaptation.",
  "17. They are divided into 6 key sectors related to the adaptation strategy under the Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050), which are 1) water management, 2) agriculture and food security, 3) tourism, 4) public health, 5) natural resources management, and 6) human settlements and security.",
  "19.

  "25. The key principles include sufficiency economy, sustainable development, human right and gender responsiveness, community-based adaptation, proactive principle, resource efficiency, good governance and public participation, local wisdom, and ecosystem-based adaptation.",
  "28. Relevant agencies in these sectors are now in the process of formulating specific sectoral plans to address climate change.",
  "4.5 Adaptation Priorities and Barriers The barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation can be divided into two types, i.e., sector-specific challenges and cross-cutting challenges.",
  "6. Sector Barriers and Challenges Water management • Given that there are several government agencies involved in the water resource management, integration and coordination in the execution and implementation of adaptation actions play a crucial role.",
  "7. However, at present, there is still limited integration and coordination among water management related agencies.",
  "8. Agriculture and food security • Thai farmers lack knowledge in adapting to climate change and cannot access technologies that help them adapt to climate change • Thai farmers lack access to capital or finance that is necessary for implementing adaptation actions Tourism • Tourists and tourism businesses lack knowledge of the impact of climate change on the tourism sector as well as knowledge on how to adapt to climate change. • Inadequate dissemination and communication of climate change impacts to domestic and international tourists as well as the tourism businesses. • Tourism businesses lack access funding to finance the adaptation activities and the preparation of climate-resilient infrastructure.",
  "9. Public health • Public health personnel still lack awareness and knowledge of the relationship between climate change and public health. • Limited research on the climate-related diseases • Lack of central database on the impacts of climate change on human health both at the national and local level Natural resource management • Limited knowledge and research on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems – both terrestrial and marine and coastal ecosystems. • Environment-related government agencies at the local level lack funding, personnel and knowledge to implement adaptation measures to prevent natural resources and ecosystems from impacts of climate change.",
  "10. Human settlement and security • Lack of downscaled climate change data at the local level to be used for climate change adaptation planning The cross-cutting barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation measures in Thailand are as follows: • Limitation of knowledge: the personnel that are key to the implementation of adaptation measures lack knowledge of the impacts of climate change and the appropriate adaptation measures. • Lack of continued financial support: some multi-year adaptation projects lack continued financial support, slowing down the progress of adaptation actions. • Lack of central database: different government agencies have their own climate change data and lack coordination and integration of data on climate change projection and impacts. • Lack of national climate information center: Thailand does not have national information center that compiles climate-related information. • Lack of access to adaptation technologies: not all adaptation technologies are accessible by stakeholders",
  "11. However, there have also been barriers and challenges encountered in terms of insufficient institutional capacities, limited knowledge and understanding of climate change adaptation, ineffective system coordination, fragmentation of projects with discontinued funding supports, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation system.",
  "12. Given the implementation challenges combined with projected climate risks in both the near and far future, it is essential that the whole national system for climate change adaptation be strengthened to effectively and timely address the current and emerging “Shocks” in order to prevent losses and damages to its economy, society, and environment.",
  "15. System and Mechanism Although the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and related adaptation strategic plans have been well formulated to provide a clear policy direction and guidance for climate adaptation actions across sectors in Thailand, they need to be supported with a system that is unified and effective, being able to connect all related agencies with well-functioning coordination mechanisms, common and accessible databases and research information, knowledge sharing and innovation platforms, network of experts, financing plans, and M&E system.",
  "16. Currently, the existing system has not well functioned, and both general knowledge and technical capacities of related government agencies in respect of climate adaptation have not been aligned to one another, resulting in fragmentation of programme and projects formulated, budget allocated, and investments undertaken.",
  "17. Insufficient coordination among agencies has currently hindered synergy for collective efforts, and also efficiency of resource utilization (e.g. personnel, finance, etc.).",
  "18. The national M&E system should be established to assess overall implementation challenges and constraints, and to provide policy makers and main stakeholders with accurate, evidence-based reporting, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing of ongoing interventions with early indications of progress or challenges in the achievement of results.",
  "19. The existing capacity building program for government agencies should be reviewed and strengthened to be more strategic, aimed at enhancing their comprehensions and competencies in designing and formulating adaptation related programmes and projects, integrating climate change adaptation into their existing functional programmes/ projects, and being able to demonstrate adaptation co-benefits of their budget requests to the policy makers and budget related agencies.",
  "20. Essentially, there is a need to evaluate how the existing capacity building programme currently functions and how it can be improved to enhance the nation-wide adaptation capacities.",
  "22. Budget With the current and future climate change risks projected, adaptation efforts require greater amount of budget due to increases in frequency and magnitude of impacts as well as multi-year investment requirements.",
  "23. However, the government budget is fairly constrained as Thailand is projected to face multi-facet challenges in the future, worsening the prospect for financing climate change adaptation.",
  "24. In this regard, the Thai government must be more innovative and strategic in fund mobilization and utilization to support adaptation actions.",
  "25. In terms of fund mobilization, it is essential that innovative financing measures resting on fiscal and monetary instruments (e.g., taxes, bonds, etc.) as well as private innovative financing scheme (e.g., crowd funding) be initiated and experimented with an aim to supplement the existing public budget that is too small to accommodate the larger scale and magnitude of climate impacts.",
  "26. An emphasis should be placed on strategic short, medium, and long-term financing plans to determine suitable financing sources (e.g., domestic, international, private) and appropriate types for different interventions.",
  "27. With regards to fund utilization, it is more efficient and effective if such limited government budget is geared toward investments that • Are potentially beneficial to all related agencies; for example, investments in the central database system, climate downscaling, technical capacity building, and risk and vulnerability analysis.",
  "28. These types of investments would enhance cross-utilization by different agencies and can support their designs and formulation on effective policy and programme; • Target vulnerable regions/population/sectors specified in the risk map analysis; • Introduce technology that can be applicable and adaptable to different contexts; • Emphasize adaptation measures that can be implemented with low investment costs, but are highly shock responsive and also widely accessible to the public at large; and • Generate good practices, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing, leading to upscaling, replication, and empowering innovation capacities.",
  "29. 4.6.2 Support Needed Based on the above recommendations to strengthen Thailand’s climate change adaptation system to effectively address the current and future climate risks, key areas urgently required for technical support can be identified as follows: 1.",
  "30. Data system Technical support is required to strengthen the nationwide data system for climate change adaptation across different spatial scales and sectors which is reliable and up-to date, publicly available, and accessible by both national and sub-national government and non- government agencies.",
  "33. Hence, there are still ample rooms for technical support to enhance both the provision of data (e.g., quality, availability, facilities, management, etc.) and the uptake/utilization of such data (e.g., capacity to interpret and analyze climate data for planning, programming, and decision making) across key adaptation sectors.",
  "35. Monitoring and Evaluation System Technical supports for designing and establishing the national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for climate change adaptation are essential for the long-term success and effectiveness of adaptation actions that are in line with the National Adaptation Plan and Strategy.",
  "36. Importantly, the M&E for climate change adaptation is different from other regular M&E in a sense that the time frames associated with climate change and the associated adaptation outcomes are likely to be longer.",
  "37. Moreover, there is uncertainty associated with the magnitude and nature of climate change, particularly at the local level, which can influence monitoring results and the ways in which they are evaluated.",
  "39. In this regard, there are challenges associated with the M&E for adaptation e.g., knowledge and understanding of budget and policy related agencies with respect to the long time scale of climate change and its impacts, capacities of related government agencies to formulate practical M&E process, etc., and thus technical supports are required to address such challenges.",
  "41. Financing mechanisms Different venues for adaptation financing are essential for addressing the current constraint of the government budget.",
  "42. Normally, several adaptation actions require substantive upfront investments for climate-resilient infrastructure, and these may not yield immediate benefits (due to the longer time frame associated with climate change) envisaged by budget-related agencies and donors.",
  "45. Therefore, it is essential that Thailand receives technical support to enhance the capacities of both finance and climate-related agencies to initiate innovative financing measures that could sustainably support adaptation investments in the future.",
  "46. OTHER INFORMATION AND RELEVANT ACTIVITIES Climate actions entail other relevant activities that complement and empower the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures.",
  "47. These activities include technology development and transfer; research and systematic observation; education, training, public awareness, public participation, and public access to climate information; capacity building; and information sharing and networking.",
  "48. To illustrate, Thailand cannot successfully implement mitigation and adaptation measures without having efficient climate technology or accurate climate knowledge and data to fully consider the vulnerability of the current situation and enable proper climate policy and decision-making process.",
  "49. Plus, the governmental agencies, the private sectors, and the public cannot embrace fundamental change in their practices and ways of living to reach carbon neutrality and climate resilience unless they have access to comprehensive and accurate climate knowledge and information.",
  "50. This chapter depicts the policy frameworks, key activities, and international cooperation of Thailand's climate actions beyond mitigation and adaptation measures.",
  "1. First, it describes Thailand's development of climate technology database and roadmaps, key technology development, and its technology transfer mechanism.",

  "Continued implementation of the planned activities under the WEM scenario would bring the emissions down to 367,603 Gg CO2 eq.",
  "If further mitigation activities under the WAM scenario are carried out, the GHG emissions could reduce to 337,554 Gg CO2 eq.",
  "For the WEM scenario without LULUCF, the GHG emissions from the energy sector is likely to be 80% of the total emissions in 2030.",

  "For WAM scenario, the energy demand in 2020 and 2030 will be 68.0 Mtoe and 89.8 Mtoe respectively.",
  "The results indicate that more aggressive energy efficiency programmes across the sectors need to be put in place to reduce the demand.",
  "In tandem with the growth in energy demand, the GHG emissions for the energy sector for WOM scenario will also to grow over the projected time period.",
  "However, the GHG emission for the WEM and WAM scenarios will be relatively lower than WOM due to the effects of the aforementioned mitigation measures in the WEM and WAM scenarios.",
  "Under the WEM scenario, where existing mitigation policies are implemented, the emissions are expected to be reduced by 6.4% (17,506 Gg CO2 eq) by 2020 and up to 22.7% (79,242 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030, relative to the WOM scenario.",

  "1. However, the magnitude of GHG emission is estimated to be reduced in both WEM and WAM scenarios.",
  "2. In the WEM scenario, the GHG emissions will decrease from 101,206 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 98,657 Gg CO2 eq in 2030.",
  "3. For the WAM scenario, GHG emissions is estimated at 100,622 CO2 eq and 91,442 CO2 eq in 2020 and 2030 each.",
  "4. These results indicate that increase of RE capacity in power generation and energy efficiency initiatives are necessary to help reduce emissions from this sub-sector.",
  "5. The largest increase in GHG emissions in the energy sector comes from the manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector, increasing from 35,416 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 55,580 CO2eq in 2030 for the WEM scenario.",
  "6. In 2020 and 2030, the value of estimated GHG emissions is 35,391 and 55,544 CO2 eq respectively under the WAM scenario.",
  "7. These increases will require further effort to reduce the GHG emissions of the manufacturing industries and construction sub-sector through certain initiatives and policies while supporting the competitiveness of the industry.",
  "8. The second largest increase in projected GHG emissions is from the transportation sub-sector, increasing from 63,382 Gg CO2 eq in 2020 to 66,334 Gg CO2eq in 2030 for WEM scenario and from 62,104 Gg CO2 eq to 64,473 Gg CO2 eq in 2030 under WAM scenario.",
  "10. The GHG emissions reduction projected for the WEM and WAM scenarios are based on the mitigation actions mentioned in Table 3.6.",
  "12. GHG emissions from industrial processes however were projected to increase in these sub-sectors over the next decade due to expansion of production capacity, especially in the iron and steel industry.",
  "13. Emissions from the iron and steel industry would depend on control on the number and capacity of iron and steel mills approved for production.",
  "14. Except for the cement and iron and steel industries, differences in the GHG emissions between WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios for the other sub-sectors in this assessment were basically based on production growth rates.",
  "18. Reduction of emissions from energy usage has been taken into account in the energy sector calculations, hence this section shall only concentrate on the option of decreasing the share of clinker in cement production by adding additives like fly ash.",
  "19. In the first Biennial Update Report (BUR1), it has been recommended that the cement industry in Malaysia could reduce its clinker ratio to 0.75:1 by the year 2030 to help reduce emissions from cement production.",
  "26. The GHG emission is projected to grow from 32,853 Gg CO2 eq in 2019 to 82,462 Gg CO2 eq, 56,585 Gg CO2 eq and 50,662 Gg CO2 eq for the WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively in 2030.",
  "28. 3.3.3.3 Agriculture As mentioned earlier food security is one of the key concerns of Malaysia.",
  "29. In 2019 emissions from the agriculture sector was about 9,922 Gg CO2 eq., with direct N2O emissions from managed soils accounting for about 3,737 Gg CO2 eq. (37.7%) of the emissions and rice cultivations accounting for about 2,269 Gg CO2 eq. (22.9%) of the emissions.",
  "30. Increasing self-sufficiency in food production especially livestock would lead to increase level of GHG emissions.",
  "31. Reducing emissions from the agriculture sector through good agriculture practices would include optimising the usage of synthetic fertiliser for crop yield.",
  "32. This can be achieved by applying what is commonly known as the 4R's: Right N application rate Right formulation (fertiliser type) Right timing of application, and Right placement Discussions with the agriculture research institutions indicate the possibility of reduction of about 10% of synthetic fertiliser application through the 4R strategy for oil palm cultivation, the largest crop under cultivation in Malaysia.",
  "39. For rice cultivations, increasing productivity per hectare of paddy planted area especially in the irrigated granaries, would reduce the need of additional land for rice cultivation.",
  "42. Livestock population emissions were modelled based on the full achievement of NAP 2.0 meat and dairy self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) targets for the WOM case and the 66% achievement of NAP 2.0 SSR targets for the WEM case based on historical trends and from reverse investment initiatives.",
  "43. While the achievement of the 33% SSR objective for the WAM is because of food imports contributing to a decrease in GHG emissions.",
  "46. Out of the 28,257 Gg CO2 eq. of GHG emissions from this sector in 2019, industrial waste water treatment and discharge contributed 51% (14,462 Gg CO2 eq.) of the emissions with nearly 99% of this part of the emission coming from POME.",
  "48. Logically the mitigation efforts in this sector should be focused on reducing methane emissions from solid waste disposal sites and from POME.",
  "For methane recovery from POME, although the earlier policies proposed the implementation of biogas capture facilities for 500 palm oil mills by 2020, the uptake by that industry has been slower than expected where in 2019 only 125 out of 452 palm oil mills have been fully equipped with biogas capture facilities.",
  "It is evident that greater push for implementation of biogas capture facilities in palm oil mills is needed.",
  "Mitigation Actions WOM Scenario WEM Scenario WAM Scenario Increase solid waste recycling rate: (i) Encouraging waste separation at source; (ii) Reduction of organic waste generation; (iii) Paper recycling activities; (iv) Encouraging 3R and using waste as a resource for other industries.",

  "Mitigation Actions WOM Scenario WEM Scenario WAM Scenario Increase proper treatment of industrial wastewater: (i) Increase capture of methane from POME by installing biogas capture facilities in existing palm oil mills and mandatory for new palm oil mills to install biogas capture facilities.",
  "Methane captured in POME biogas treatment facilities is 50% for flaring and 50% for energy use.",
  "The number of biogas capture facilities at POME treatment sites increase by five per year.",
  "This could be achieved by diverting organic wastes away from landfills for treatment and greater implementation ambition on establishing biogas capture facilities at palm oil mills as well as better flaring efficiency and usage of the methane captured in these facilities for energy generation.",
  "The recycling rate increases from 31% in 2019 to 40% by 2025 and remains at that value till 2030.",
  "Projected forest loss between 2020 and 2030 was derived from historic rate of forest conversion.",
  "Forest loss of 65,000 ha per year is expected under the WOM scenario between 2020 and 2030 while in the WEM and WAM scenarios, 50,000 ha and 47,000 ha respectively were projected to be lost annually over the same period.",
  "With the implementation of sustainable forest management and forest certification, the maximum harvest is limited to 85m3/ha and follows all the principles, criteria and indicators set in Malaysia Criteria and Indicator (MC&I).",
  "By 2030, with the decreasing harvest rate from 2025 onwards, the projected commercial harvest is around 16.051 million m3 per year, 14.891 million m3 per year and 13.726 million m3 per year for WOM, WEM and WAM scenarios respectively.",
  "The expansion of cropland area is limited in Malaysia due to limited arable land targeted for agriculture.",
  "Projected LULUCF Emissions and Removals For the forest category, enhancing sustainable forest management (SFM) and conservation would reduce emission.",
  "The implementation of CFS and HoB have potential to increase forest connectivity and enhance removals.",
  "It is anticipated that future supply of wood from the plantation forest would increase and lesser harvesting would occur from natural forest.",
  "For Cropland, marginal increase in removals is anticipated while conversion of cropland to settlement would also be stabilised.",
  "The total emission and removals from forest and crop land is shown in Table 3.17 under the three scenarios.",
  "As mitigation actions through different policies and programmes are being implemented across the different Ministries and Agencies, a coherent and robust Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System is necessary for keeping track of the integrated impacts of these implementations in reducing the GHG emissions in the country.",
  "A step-wise approach has been taken in developing this system in Malaysia with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability as the Secretariat to the Technical Working Group of Mitigation and Technical Working Group on Transparency and Related Activities.",
  "In moving strategic directions in implementing the policies that will give effect to GHG emission reduction, one of the critical information that is sought by policymakers is accurate information on projection of future GHG emissions.",
  "The current efforts in modelling the projected emissions are the efforts in providing such information for informed decisions making on strategic directions for implementing mitigation actions.",
  "More accurate modelling is required, in particular those coupled with accurate information on abatement costs.",

  "A number of improvements for climate and sea level rise (SLR) projections had been carried out in this assessment as summarised in Table 4.1.",
  "The major improvements include flood areal extent analysis for Sabah and Sarawak, dry spell analysis for the whole of Malaysia, coastal inundation analysis, and projected extreme events associated with return periods for sectoral vulnerability and impact assessment purposes.",
  "The assessment on impacts of floods, dry spells, extreme high temperatures and extreme wet events, were carried out based on the hydroclimate data projected under the RCP 6.0, while the assessment on impacts of SLR and coastal inundation were carried out based on the sea level data projected under the RCP 8.5.",
  "The RCP 6.0 scenario was chosen since this RCP is almost similar to the SRES A1B that was used in NC3 as well as being close to the current anthropogenic global warming rate.",
  "For SLR, the RCP 8.5 was chosen in order to take into account the impacts of other coastal hazard such as storm surges and wind generated wave which are not included in the static SLR vulnerability assessment that was adopted in this report.",
  "Flood Areal Extent There are 191 river basins in Malaysia, and of these, 144 river basins (86 in Peninsular Malaysia, 32 in Sabah and 26 in Sarawak) are prone to flooding.",

  "The total area of these river basins is about 232,002 km2, which covers 70.3% of Malaysia’s land area.",
  "The flood assessments in Malaysia are based on flood extent maps associated with a 100-year Return Period for the time horizons projection of 2100.",

  "A smaller increase of 5.2% and 3.5% were projected for Sabah and Sarawak respectively, for the same time horizon.",
  "Under the future scenario, majority of the river basins in Peninsular Malaysia, except for Johor river basin and Muda river basin, could have more than 15% increment in their flood prone areas up to 2100, with Kerian river basin in Perak’s increment possibly reaching 33.7%.",
  "In Sabah, the flood prone areas at Sg Kalumpang river basin, Sg Sinsilog river basin, Trusan Kinabatangan river basin, Sg Segama river basin, Sg Tuaran river basin, Sg Papar river basin and Sg Labuk river basin were projected to increase up to 2100 with the highest increment anticipated at Sg Tuaran river basin (+17.6%).",
  "In Sarawak, the situation could be more moderate as compared to Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, where majority of the river basins could face less than 5% of increment except for Batang Baram river basin (+9.2%), Sg Sarawak river basin (+9.3%), Batang Kemena river basin (+7.4%) and Batang Saribas river basin (+6.7%).",

  "The west coast of Peninsular Malaysia along the Straits of Malacca could be more vulnerable to coastal flooding compared to the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.",
  "According to the impact assessment on coastal floods based on the projected coastal inundation areas by 2100 carried out for Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan, there is around 16.6 million of people could be affected by coastal floods due to SLR by 2100.",
  "Coastal flooding due to SLR was projected to increase the vulnerability of the coastal community.",
  "Continuous groundwater level and quality monitoring at some selected deep seated tube wells is important and being conducted by the Department of Minerals and Geosciences (DMG) Malaysia.",
  "Saltwater intrusion and coastal inundation due to SLR is a risk to groundwater quality.",
  "In addition, over-extraction could result in increased saline intrusion for wells located nearer to the coast.",
  "This could be due to the adaptation measures that had been taken.",
  "SLR can result in potentially adverse impacts of coastal flooding, accelerated coastal erosion and land subsidence.",
  "SLR is ultimately responsible for long-term coastal erosion problems.",
  "Based on the assessment along the 3,800 km of coastline in Peninsular Malaysia and Federal Territory of Labuan using the Physical Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI) adapted in the revised National Coastal Vulnerability Index (NCVI) 2021, Selangor could be the most vulnerable state with almost 80% of its coastal areas exposed to the threat of erosion.",
  "Policies, Frameworks and National Plans The National Water Policy (NWP), which is in the final stage of preparation, is one of the key milestones towards a more sustainable and integrated management of water resources in the country in order to face the challenges posed by climate change.",
  "The Fourth National Physical Plan (NPP4) 2020 highlighted the need for planning for sustainable water uses in the context of climate change.",
  "Among others, this has been done through the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, and the Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) that supports the relevant state water authorities in the management of their resources.",
  "Since the NC3, the protection of dam water catchment areas had been implemented to ensure adequate water storage inflow into the dam reservoirs.",
  "There are around 170 permanent reserved forests already gazetted as water catchment areas in the country.",
  "There is also a plan to gazette more of these forests in order to secure and enlarge the reservoir storage.",
  "The National Water Balance Management System (NAWABS), which acts as a water management tool and uses the water balance concept to inform on water availability for the purpose of planning and operational decision-making during droughts and dry periods, has its first phase implemented and completed at the Kedah River basin, Muda River basin, Bernam River basin, Melaka River basin and the Kelantan River basin in 2020 to test its efficacy.",

  "With regards to the dam safety issues due to the dam structures and extreme rainfall at the water catchment areas, the Malaysia Dam Safety Management Guidelines (MyDAMS) established in 2017 is being used to monitor to ensure the safety of dams.",
  "This framework also aims to facilitate the formulation of sound policies and best practices that support sustainable water management and ensure water security, especially in dealing with climate change impacts.",
  "This could be due to the adaptation measures that had been taken.",
  "To support water supply sustainability, especially during the prolonged dry spells, DMG has initiated a few programmes for the development of groundwater resources in some water stressed areas in the country.",
  "Under the Hydrogeological Mapping and Groundwater Development Project initiated in Kedah, a groundwater quantity and quality monitoring well would be installed with a telemetry system to measure parameters such as conductivity, water level, temperature, total dissolved solids and salinity.",
