    "In\nparticular, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) revealed the wide-spread and severe\nclimate impacts in the near term, escalating risk from higher temperatures causing\nirreversible climate change impacts, and increased vulnerability to climate risks due\nto inequality and development challenges, all of which indicate that the world needs\nurgent mitigation and adaptation actions to address loss and damages.",
    "Thus,\na monumental step was made at COP26 when all member states came together with\nthe ambitious decision to put their best efforts into limiting the average temperature\nincrease to less than 1.5°C.",
    "To achieve this goal, global net-zero greenhouse gas\nemissions must be pursued by 2050.",
    "Thailand recognizes the severe impacts of climate change and the significance of holding\nthe increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to\nlimit the increase to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement.",
    "At COP26 World Leaders\nSummit, Thailand announced the country’s new ambitious targets to reach carbon\nneutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and 2065, respectively,\nand increase NDC contributions up to 40% upon timely and adequate international\nsupport on finance, technology transfer, and capacity building.",
    "In terms of actions,\nThailand has mainstreamed climate change agenda into its national plans: the 20-Year\nNational Strategy, National Economic and Social Development Plans, Climate Change\nMaster Plan, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action\n(NAMA), and Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).",
    "Furthermore, the Long-Term\nLow Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) and the 2nd updated\nNDC were revised and submitted to UNFCCC by COP27.",
    "The revisions focus on the\nalignment of mitigation measures and 2050 carbon neutrality and 2065 net-zero GHG\nemissions, just transition, and optimization of socio-economic impacts.",
    "In the 2nd\nupdated NDC, Thailand elevated the contribution level to 40%, with 30% from our\ndomestic effort and 10% from international support.",
    "This target is challenging for the\nenergy, transport, and agriculture sectors.",
    "The challenge also includes raising awareness\nand participation from all relevant sectors, particularly the private sector, which urgently\nneeds to adapt and enhance its capacity for business competition to keep pace with\nthe rapidly changing global circumstances and trends.",
    "Thailand’s Fourth National Communication (NC4) has been prepared in accordance with\nUNFCCC guideline.",
    "The NC4 is a medium for Thailand to communicate its commitment\nto fulfilling the obligations under Article 4.1 and 12.1 of the UNFCCC.",
    "It presents\nupdated and more comprehensive information on the national circumstances;\ninstitutional arrangements; national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory; mitigation\npolicies, plans, and measures; achievement of GHG emissions reduction under NAMA;\npreparation for the implementation of NDC; vulnerability and adaptation; other\ninformation and activities relevant to climate actions; and constraints, gaps, support\nneeded, and support received to implement its adaptation and mitigation actions.",
    "The\nchapter on vulnerability and adaptation also serves as Thailand’s first adaptation\ncommunication.",
    "On behalf of the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning\n(ONEP), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), I would like to\nexpress my sincere gratitude to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the funding and\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a coordinating and implementing\nagency, for its technical support.",
    "My appreciation also extends to representatives of\nMinistries, sub-national government agencies, academic institutions, private sectors,\ncivil societies, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies for their\ncontributions in the preparation of this report.",
    "Thailand will continue to put the utmost effort into prioritizing and implementing our\npolicies to combat climate change and limit the increase of global average temperature\nunder the Paris Agreement according to the country’s vision toward net-zero GHG\nemissions by the second half of this century.",

    "Thailand submitted its\nfirst, second, and third NC on 13 November 2000, 24 March 2011, and 29 August 2018,\nrespectively.",
    "This report, the fourth NC (NC4), has demonstrated the country’s intention\nto actively implement climate actions and share the results with UNFCCC and the global\ncommunity.",
    "According to Conference of the Parties (COP) guidelines, the NC4 consists\nof 6 chapters as follows:\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe physical context reveals the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts as\nabove-average temperatures tend to rise, precipitation has fluctuated over time,\npopulation structure is becoming an “aging society,” and its long coastal zone faces\ncoastal erosion and sea-level rise.",
    "Thailand relies largely on commercial energy\nproduction and consumption, but renewable energy shares have continued to increase.",
    "The country’s natural resources exhibit not only the abundance and absorptive capacity\nbut also the degrading conditions from climate-induced disasters.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic contraction during 2019-2020.",
    "In particular, the tourism sector, which had always been a significant part of Thailand’s\neconomic growth generating approximately 20-22% of GDP, suffered a drastic decline.",
    "This resulted in an increase in plastic and infectious wastes and a slight increase in the\npoverty line and inequality indicators.",
    "On the positive side, the COVID-19 controlling\nmeasures led to a reduction in energy consumption and production, improvement in\noverall air quality due to less traffic circulation in the transport sector and economic\nactivities, a general decline of all other diseases, reinforcement of Thailand's healthcare\nsystem for coping with newly emerged diseases, and recovery of natural resources in\ntouristic sites.",
    "As a final point, National Committee on Climate Change Policy (NCCC) serves as a\nnational institute overseeing climate policy development and implementation.",

    "2.4.4 Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF)\nAlthough the MRV systems for the LULUCF sector have been developed and\nimplemented among the relevant stakeholders, activity data relevant to forest land remains\nincomplete because forest areas in the LULUCF sector involve multiple departments (i.e.,\nRoyal Forest Department and Forest Industry Organization).",
    "For instance, there is also\na gap between public and private data on forest plantation areas.",
    "In addition, activity data\nfor biomass burning in forest land reported by various departments remains unclear in\nterms of burned areas and/or land categories.",
    "To provide more accurate GHG estimation\nand adopt the higher IPCC methodologies, remote sensing-based monitoring of land\nuse and land cover is needed to classify types of natural forests and forest plantations,\nmonitor their changes, and detect forest area burning.",
    "Although cropland and forest land are key land categories contributing to the GHG\nnet removals in the LULUCF sector, wood harvested from either cropland or forest\nplantations is not reported except for those reported by Forest Industry Organization.",
    "Thus, an approach must be developed for the government and private sector to enhance\nthe MRV systems of essential activity data for the LULUCF sector.",
    "Country-specific values are applied in most LULUCF categories, but some emission\nfactors are adopted from IPCC defaults due to the use of the IPCC-2006 guidelines (i.e.,\nbelow-ground to above-ground biomass ratio for natural forest and woody crops,\ndeadwood and organic litters, trace gases emission ratio and uncertainty estimation).",
    "Furthermore, some parameters are not adequate to be used as national representatives\ndue to the limitation of information (i.e., country-specific values relevant to croplands).",

    "Technical and\nfunding support is required for capacity building within relevant agencies.",
    "Development of country-specific values of emission factors for solid waste disposal and\nwastewater treatment and discharge of both domestic and industrial sources is also\nneeded to improve data collection according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",
    "This includes,\nfor example, reaction constants and half-lives in the degradation of specific compositions\nof solid waste, the maximum methane producing capacity, and a methane correction\nfactor for the wastewater treatment and discharge system.",

    "Human settlement and security\n• Lack of downscaled climate change data at the local level to be used\nfor climate change adaptation planning\nThe cross-cutting barriers and challenges in the implementation of adaptation measures\nin Thailand are as follows:\n• Limitation of knowledge: the personnel that are key to the implementation\nof adaptation measures lack knowledge of the impacts of climate change and the\nappropriate adaptation measures.\n• Lack of continued financial support: some multi-year adaptation projects lack\ncontinued financial support, slowing down the progress of adaptation actions.\n• Lack of central database: different government agencies have their own climate\nchange data and lack coordination and integration of data on climate change projection\nand impacts.\n• Lack of national climate information center: Thailand does not have national\ninformation center that compiles climate-related information.\n• Lack of access to adaptation technologies: not all adaptation technologies\nare accessible by stakeholders\n4.6 Recommendations and Support Needed\nSo far, there have been several adaptation initiatives undertaken in water management,\nagriculture, tourism, health, ecosystem, and human settlements and security in\nThailand, beingthose at the policy and planning level or actions on the ground.",
    "However, there have also been barriers and challenges encountered in terms of insufficient\ninstitutional capacities, limited knowledge and understanding of climate change\nadaptation, ineffective system coordination, fragmentation of projects with\ndiscontinued funding supports, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation system.",
    "Given the implementation challenges combined with projected climate risks in both\nthe near and far future, it is essential that the whole national system for climate change\nadaptation be strengthened to effectively and timely address the current and emerging\n“Shocks” in order to prevent losses and damages to its economy, society, and environment.",
    "The section below puts forward key recommendations for addressing the barriers and\nchallenges earlierindicated.",
    "4.6.1 Key recommendations\n1.",
    "System and Mechanism\nAlthough the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and related adaptation strategic plans\nhave been well formulated to provide a clear policy direction and guidance for climate\nadaptation actions across sectors in Thailand, they need to be supported with a system\nthat is unified and effective, being able to connect all related agencies with\nwell-functioning coordination mechanisms, common and accessible databases and\nresearch information, knowledge sharing and innovation platforms, network of experts,\nfinancing plans, and M&E system.",
    "Currently, the existing system has not well functioned,\nand both general knowledge and technical capacities of related government agencies\nin respect of climate adaptation have not been aligned to one another, resulting in\nfragmentation of programme and projects formulated, budget allocated, and investments\nundertaken.",
    "Insufficient coordination among agencies has currently hindered synergy for\ncollective efforts, and also efficiency of resource utilization (e.g. personnel, finance, etc.).",
    "The national M&E system should be established to assess overall implementation\nchallenges and constraints, and to provide policy makers and main stakeholders with\naccurate, evidence-based reporting, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing of ongoing\ninterventions with early indications of progress or challenges in the achievement of results.",
    "The existing capacity building program for government agencies should be reviewed\nand strengthened to be more strategic, aimed at enhancing their comprehensions and\ncompetencies in designing and formulating adaptation related programmes and\nprojects, integrating climate change adaptation into their existing functional programmes/\nprojects, and being able to demonstrate adaptation co-benefits of their budget requests to\nthe policy makers and budget related agencies.",
    "Essentially, there is a need to evaluate\nhow the existing capacity building programme currently functions and how it can be\nimproved to enhance the nation-wide adaptation capacities.",
    "2.",
    "Budget\nWith the current and future climate change risks projected, adaptation efforts require\ngreater amount of budget due to increases in frequency and magnitude of impacts as\nwell as multi-year investment requirements.",
    "However, the government budget is fairly\nconstrained as Thailand is projected to face multi-facet challenges in the future,\nworsening the prospect for financing climate change adaptation.",
    "In this regard, the Thai\ngovernment must be more innovative and strategic in fund mobilization and utilization\nto support adaptation actions.",
    "In terms of fund mobilization, it is essential that innovative financing measures resting\non fiscal and monetary instruments (e.g., taxes, bonds, etc.) as well as private innovative\nfinancing scheme (e.g., crowd funding) be initiated and experimented with an aim to\nsupplement the existing public budget that is too small to accommodate the larger scale\nand magnitude of climate impacts.",
    "An emphasis should be placed on strategic short,\nmedium, and long-term financing plans to determine suitable financing sources (e.g.,\ndomestic, international, private) and appropriate types for different interventions.",
    "With regards to fund utilization, it is more efficient and effective if such limited government\nbudget is geared toward investments that\n• Are potentially beneficial to all related agencies; for example, investments in\nthe central database system, climate downscaling, technical capacity building, and risk\nand vulnerability analysis.",
    "These types of investments would enhance cross-utilization\nby different agencies and can support their designs and formulation on effective policy\nand programme;\n• Target vulnerable regions/population/sectors specified in the risk map analysis;\n• Introduce technology that can be applicable and adaptable to different contexts;\n• Emphasize adaptation measures that can be implemented with low investment\ncosts, but are highly shock responsive and also widely accessible to the public at large;\nand\n• Generate good practices, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing, leading to\nupscaling, replication, and empowering innovation capacities.",
    "4.6.2 Support Needed\nBased on the above recommendations to strengthen Thailand’s climate change adaptation\nsystem to effectively address the current and future climate risks, key areas urgently\nrequired for technical support can be identified as follows:\n1.",
    "Data system\nTechnical support is required to strengthen the nationwide data system for climate change\nadaptation across different spatial scales and sectors which is reliable and up-to date,\npublicly available, and accessible by both national and sub-national government and\nnon- government agencies.",
    "Normally, there are different stages for climate adaptation\nplanning and implementation starting from (i) assessing climate impacts, vulnerability,\nrisks, and resilience, (ii) planning for adaptation, (iii) implementing adaptation measures,\nand (iv) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation measures.",
    "Each stage also\nrequires different combinations of observed, forecast/projected, and historical\nclimate and socio-economic data.",
    "Hence, there are still ample rooms for technical support\nto enhance both the provision of data (e.g., quality, availability, facilities, management,\netc.) and the uptake/utilization of such data (e.g., capacity to interpret and analyze climate\ndata for planning, programming, and decision making) across key adaptation sectors.",
    "2.",
    "Monitoring and Evaluation System\nTechnical supports for designing and establishing the national monitoring and\nevaluation (M&E) system for climate change adaptation are essential for the long-term\nsuccess and effectiveness of adaptation actions that are in line with the National Adaptation\nPlan and Strategy.",
    "Importantly, the M&E for climate change adaptation is different from\nother regular M&E in a sense that the time frames associated with climate change and\nthe associated adaptation outcomes are likely to be longer.",
    "Moreover, there is uncertainty\nassociated with the magnitude and nature of climate change, particularly at the local\nlevel, which can influence monitoring results and the ways in which they are evaluated.",
    "In\naddition, a continually changing climate means that traditional approaches to measuring\nchange, such as comparing monitoring results to static baseline conditions, may not be\npossible, and a moving baseline must be considered.",
    "In this regard, there are challenges\nassociated with the M&E for adaptation e.g., knowledge and understanding of budget\nand policy related agencies with respect to the long time scale of climate change and its\nimpacts, capacities of related government agencies to formulate practical M&E process,\netc., and thus technical supports are required to address such challenges.",
    "3.",
    "Financing mechanisms\nDifferent venues for adaptation financing are essential for addressing the current constraint\nof the government budget.",
    "Normally, several adaptation actions require substantive\nupfront investments for climate-resilient infrastructure, and these may not yield\nimmediate benefits (due to the longer time frame associated with climate change)\nenvisaged by budget-related agencies and donors.",
    "Moreover, adaptation investments,\nin nature, tend to be public goods that cannot easily leverage finance from the private\nsector unless they are directly impacted.",
    "Also, several international climate-related funds\ntarget mitigation rather than adaptation activities as the former yield immediate results\nthat can be realized now e.g., investments in energy efficiency improvements offer\nimmediate energy cost savings.",
    "Therefore, it is essential that Thailand receives technical\nsupport to enhance the capacities of both finance and climate-related agencies\nto initiate innovative financing measures that could sustainably support adaptation\ninvestments in the future.",
    "OTHER INFORMATION AND\nRELEVANT ACTIVITIES\nOTHER INFORMATION AND\nRELEVANT ACTIVITIES\nClimate actions entail other relevant activities that complement and empower\nthe implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures.",
    "These activities include\ntechnology development and transfer; research and systematic observation; education,\ntraining, public awareness, public participation, and public access to climate information;\ncapacity building; and information sharing and networking.",
    "To illustrate, Thailand cannot successfully implement mitigation and adaptation measures\nwithout having efficient climate technology or accurate climate knowledge and data to\nfully consider the vulnerability of the current situation and enable proper climate policy\nand decision-making process.",
    "Plus, the governmental agencies, the private sectors, and\nthe public cannot embrace fundamental change in their practices and ways of living to\nreach carbon neutrality and climate resilience unless they have access to comprehensive\nand accurate climate knowledge and information.",
    "This chapter depicts the policy frameworks, key activities, and international cooperation\nof Thailand's climate actions beyond mitigation and adaptation measures.",
    "First, it\ndescribes Thailand's development of climate technology database and roadmaps,\nkey technology development, and its technology transfer mechanism.",
    "The climate\ntechnology roadmaps and development align with key sectors stated in Thailand's NDC and\nThailand's NAP.",

    "Fourth, it covers a capacity-building\nframework, national initiatives, and international cooperation.",
    "Finally, it explains how ONEP\nacts as a primary entity for climate information sharing and how Thailand cooperates and\ncollaborates with international communities at bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels\nto address climate change issues.",

    "They are also distributed within the primary habitat identified as Managed Elephant\nRanges (MERs) in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, the Taman Negara Forest\nComplex, and the Endau-Rompin Forest Complex (DWNP, 2013), respectively in the\nnorth, central and southern regions of the peninsular.",
    "In Sabah, the Bornean pygmy elephants, which favour flat lands, floodplains and\nvalleys, are found in the north-eastern part of the State.",
    "A reduction of at least 60% of\npopulation was reported in 2014 due to conversion of low-lying forests in the State to\nother types of land uses, primarily for agriculture.",
    "Recently, it was estimated that the\nremaining numbers have dwindled down to not more than 1,000 to 1,500 elephants,\nroaming across the state.",
    "The major MERs in Sabah include the lower reaches of the\nKinabatangan River basin, Tabin and Central Sabah.",
    "Tiger\nMalaysia is one of the 13 nations where tigers still survive in the wild.",
    "According to The\nFirst National Tiger Survey conducted between 2016 and 2020 by PERHILITAN\nMalaysia, a total of 44,000 km2 of the Central Forest Spine (CFS) area in Peninsular\nMalaysia was considered as tiger habitats, and these include all forest types from the\nlowland forest to the mountain forest.",
    "There are four Malayan tiger forest landscapes\nin the country having been recognised in the survey, which lie across the Ulu MudaBintang Hijau Complex, Titiwangsa Main Range, Taman Negara National Park and the\nEndau-Rompin Complex.",
    "The biggest threat that the Malayan tiger faces is the illegal\nhunting, while habitat loss is another major threat.",
    "A few years back, the Malayan tiger\nwas infected by the Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), of which unfortunately, there is yet\na medicine for cure.",
    "Currently, there are no studies specifically looking into the impact of climate change on\nthe Malayan tiger.",
    "However, climate change may have a substantial undeviating\ninfluence on this critically endangered terrestrial animal, and pushing them to the brink\nof extinction.",
    "This, definitely can be accelerated by deforestation or the unsustainable\nland use development that often result in bringing more severe floods and landslide\naffecting the habitats.",
    "Unexpected forest fires due to prolonged dry spells could also\nthreaten their food sources.",
    "Sambar Deer\nSeveral studies indicated that the population of sambar deer (Rusa unicolour) showed\na decreasing trend.",
    "One of the efforts to increase the population of sambar deer in\nPeninsular Malaysia is through a breeding program at the Wildlife Conservation Centre\n(WCC) in Perak and Kelantan.",
    "Marine Ecosystem\nCoral Reefs\nClimate change is a major threat to coral loss.",
    "An increase in sea water temperatures\nof 1 to 2°C above the normal temperature level of 27 oC for a prolonged period would\nreduce coral cover through coral bleaching.",
    "Ocean warming can also indirectly kill\ncorals through creating a more favourable sea environment for increasing the incidence\nand propagation of coral diseases.",
    "The Malaysia Annual Coral Reefs Health Survey 2021 using the Reef Check Survey\nworks in collaboration with Reef Check Malaysia showed a “fair” level (25% - 50%) of\nlive coral cover of 44.26% on average (Figure 4.13 & Figure 4.14).",
    "This improvement\ncould be at least partly due to the huge reduction in tourist visitors (both international\nand domestic) to coral reefs, specifically during the pandemic movement control\noperations in 2020 and 2021.",
    "However, further monitoring is required to confirm this\nobservation which, if supported by data, may suggest that periodic site closures should\nbe seriously considered as a management improvement recovery measure for the\nfuture.\nin Peninsular Malaysia based on Live Coral Cover (Source: DOFM 2021)\nin Sabah based on Live Coral Cover (Source: DOFM 2021)\nMarine Turtles\nMalaysia is home to four of the extant species of marine turtles namely; the leatherback,\ngreen, hawksbill and olive ridley species.",

    "According to the\nSabah Parks and Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) joint studies, some of these sites,\nespecially in the Turtle Island Park, are affected by coastal erosion.",
    "Decline of hawksbill\nturtles had been observed in the Turtle Island Park due to the loss of the nesting beach\nat Gulisaan, which had suffered severe beach erosions.",
    "Currently, these parks are\nbeing monitored by the Sabah Parks and UMS under their coastal erosion\nhydrodynamics studies.",
    "Researches on impact of SLR on coastal erosion and marine\nmammals need to be conducted and advised.",
    "Marine Mammals\nTwenty-seven species of marine mammals are confirmed to be found in the waters\nsurrounding Malaysia (Jaaman, 2006; Ponnampalam, 2012).",
    "A study of marine\nmammals at Penang Island by Rajamani et al. (2018) showed that four species of\ndolphin and porpoise, regularly appear within the coastal waters.",
    "However, Penang\nIsland is a rapidly growing zone of economic importance, with massive infrastructure\nexpansion and extensive coastal zone development and reclamation already\nunderway.",
    "Thus, it is important to establish a marine mammal management plan for\nthese waters to ensure their survival.",
    "In Sabah, the Tun Mustapha Park (TMP) is generally specified as being medium in\nexposure to the impacts of SLR and waves during typhoons and monsoons based on\na climate change vulnerability assessment.",
    "However, the medium exposure impacts\ncould be due to the geographical location of TMP in the southern part of the typhoon\nbelt of the Philippines and the assessment sites were located in the most sheltered\nareas of the islands.",
    "Therefore, further researches on impact of SLR on the marine\nmammals at TMP need to be conducted and advised.",
    "4.7.2 Adaptation Measures\nForestry and Biodiversity\nExtreme weather could affect forest resilience in the long term.",
    "For example, the 1997–\n1998 El Niño drought, increased tree mortality and hence reduced the net productivity\nof the forests.",
    "Additionally, a study in Borneo has shown that fragmentation reduced\nthe forest sink and turned many edge-affected forests into a carbon source.",
    "Some\nmeasures undertaken to conserve and protect the natural ecosystem are as follows:\n● Two programmes, Central Forest Spine (CFS) and Heart of Borneo (HoB) are\nimplemented to increase resilience including to climate change of natural\necosystems.",
    "One of the strategies is to establish connectivity and corridors\nbetween forests and other ecological areas.",
    "To date, a total of 37,614 ha have\nbeen gazetted as ecological corridor under the CFS.",
    "Under the HoB, corridors\nbetween Kinabalu ECOLINC, Sipitang – Ulu Padas, Ulu Segama – Malua,\nDanum-Maliau-Imbak and Kinabatangan Corridor of Life in Sabah are being\nimplemented.",
    "Sarawak will develop action plans for their Mulu- Pulong Tau\necological linkage.",
    "This measure will increase the adaptive capacity of these\necosystems to climate change.\n● Malaysia plans to increase land surface and inland waters as protected areas or\nother effective area-based conservation measures by 20%.",
    "This will also\nintegrate the network of Community Conserved Areas (CCA) across landscapes\nand seascapes, and recognise these CCAs as an integral part of the nation’s\nprotected area network.\n● As part of forest management, a requirement of buffer strips for permanent\nstreams and rivers in Inland Forest and Peat Swamp Forest of at least 5 m in\nwidth on both sides of the stream or river and felling of trees is prohibited.\n● Forest plantation design and layout shall promote the protection, restoration and\nconservation of natural forests.",
    "Where the forest plantation is located adjacent\nto an environmentally sensitive area, an adequate buffer zone shall be\nestablished and maintained.",
    "The forest fire prevention involves agencies such as the Fire and Rescue Department,\nForestry Department and the Department of Environment.",
    "Relevant measures are\nbeing undertaken by these agencies to address the issue.",
    "The State Forestry\nDepartments have developed a plan on the prevention and control of fires within the\nnatural and plantation forests.",
    "Each state also has assigned a forestry officer to handle\nall matters pertaining to forest fires.",
    "Some of the adaptation measures put in place\ninclude infrastructure developed under the 11th Malaysia Plan including installation of\ntube wells and checked dams.",
    "For example, a monitoring tower and reservoir for\nproviding water for use during fire outbreaks were constructed in Kuala Langat Selatan\nForest Reserve, Selangor.",
    "In Sabah, monitoring of hotspots and Fire Weather Index\n(FWI) as well as ground-aerial surveillance had been put in place as measures for early\nforest fires detection.",

    "CONSTRAINTS, GAPS, LEVEL OF SUPPORT RECEIVED AND NEEDS\n7.1 Introduction\nThis chapter is an updated summary of the Constraints, Gaps, the Level of Support\nReceived and Needs as reported in Chapter 4 of the Fourth Biennial Update Report\nwhereby the details can be found in the chapter titled Level of Support Received,\nConstraints, Gaps and Needs.",
    "Financial, technical and capacity building support from international sources were\nreceived by federal and state agencies from multilateral and bilateral sources to\nimplement climate change actions.",
    "7.2 Constraints and Gaps\nChallenges remain in implementing Malaysia’s commitment to address climate\nchange and its impacts.",
    "Some of the challenges were identified by the Team of\nTechnical Experts (TTE) during the International Consultation and Analysis of\nMalaysia’s Third BUR.",
    "7.2.1 GHG Inventory and GHG Emission Projection\nFor GHG inventory and emission projection, the challenges include the development\nof country-specific emission factors, improvement of activity data collection, and longterm modelling tools for projections.",
    "Estimating GHG emissions and removals from\nsome categories are constrained by incomplete or lack of activity data and most\ncategories lack country specific emission factors.",
    "For BUR3, the TTE in consultation with Malaysia identified a need for capacity-building\nthat could facilitate the Party’s transition to the enhanced transparency framework\nunder the Paris Agreement, namely enhancing the national capacity for future scenario\nanalysis, including factor analysis and decomposition analysis at the sectoral level.",
    "As stated in BUR4, Malaysia is continuing to improve its institutional arrangement,\nactivity data collection, analysis and archiving for its GHG inventory.",
    "Efforts are being\nconcentrated on improving the disaggregation and completeness of the activity data\naccording to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and developing country specific emission\nfactors for the key categories.",
    "A National GHG Inventory Improvement Plan for\nemission factors is being implemented under the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025),\nhowever capacity building is still needed for realising these plans.",
    "7.2.2 Mitigation\nQuantification of mitigation outcomes continues to be a challenge especially when\npolicy measures do not address GHG emissions reduction.",
    "Improvement in the\naccounting methodologies for all the sectors (energy, IPPU, waste, agriculture and\nLULUCF sectors) could be further enhanced.",
    "Implementation of mitigation actions requires access to suitable cost-effective\ntechnologies.",
    "At the current moment, access to cleaner technology remains a\nconstraint, hence mitigation opportunities are limited especially for the IPPU sector.",
    "For the agriculture sector, mitigation opportunities are restrained by the need to\nprioritise food security and livelihood of farmers.",
    "Despite these challenges, policy\nmeasures are being developed especially for the energy and IPPU sectors in order to\nguide Malaysia’s NDC implementation and pathway towards net-zero emissions as\nearly as 2050.",
    "The Securities Commission, Central Bank and Bursa Malaysia require\ncompanies and financial institutions to incorporate ESG into their reporting of\nsustainability.",
    "These actions include the role of carbon markets, the adoption of new\ntechnologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and the enhanced usage\nof nature-based solutions to reduce emissions.",
    "The waste sector has already set\nambitious targets for recycling.",
    "7.2.3 Adaptation\nThe constraints and gaps for vulnerability assessment and adaptation measures had\nbeen presented in detail for each of the sectors in Chapter 4.",
    "While vulnerability\nassessment has become a periodic routine, capacity buildings to increase the\nexpertise of the personnel involved in the climate projection, vulnerability assessment\nand adaptation needs identification and implementation is required.",
    "To this end,\nMalaysia is in the process of getting approval for financial support from GCF to develop\na comprehensive National Adaptation Plan.",
    "7.3 Level of Support Received\nThe main source of international financial support is through the Global Environmental\nFacility (GEF), one of the two operating entities of the UNFCCC’s financial mechanism\nfrom cycle 1 to 7 (June 1994 to June 2022).",
    "The funding provided by GEF, other\nmultilateral agencies and bilateral sources were channeled through specific projects.",
    "Under GEF cycle 4 to 7 (June 2006 – June 2022), Malaysia was allocated an indicative\nsum of USD43.7 million and utilized USD38 million which was used to develop the\ncountry’s institutional and technical capacity on the reporting obligations to the\nUNFCCC as well as the implementation of mitigation actions.",
    "These actions were\nfacilitated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nIndustrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the International Fund for\nAgricultural Development (IFAD).",
    "Financial support through GEF-6 and GEF-7 cycles were primarily used to build up\ntechnical and technological capacities in transport, energy, forestry (including\npeatland), low carbon cities and community empowerment projects.",
    "The amount of funding provided by GEF for NC4 was USD500,000.",
    "It should be noted\nthat in the preparation of BUR4 which was submitted to the UNFCCC on 31 st\nDecember 2022, the allocation of USD352,000 from GEF for BUR3 was used.",
    "This\nwas made possible as the balance from BUR2’s allocation was used to prepare BUR3\nwhich was submitted on 31 December 2020.",
    "The other UNFCCC’s financial mechanism operating entities, the Green Climate Fund\n(GCF) has provided readiness support for Malaysia to identify energy sector\nprioritisation project, potential direct access entity and enhance its implementation\nframework to access results-based payment for the forestry sector.",
    "Other significant financial assistance is in the area of adaptation from the United\nKingdom with the allocation of £875,000 to develop capacity in forecasting local level\nclimate extremes and physical hazards as well as community level outreach for the\ncity of Kuala Lumpur.",
    "In the area of capacity-building, Malaysia received a fairly wide range of trainings\nbetween 2017 and 2019.",
    "Trainings in the areas of GHG inventory, mitigation\n(measurement, reporting and verifying emissions data), adaptation planning,\nimplementing and enhancing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), climate\nnegotiations, climate finance and Article 6 and 13 of the Paris Agreement were\nprovided by the UNFCCC’s Consultative Group of Experts, the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change, GCF, various multilateral organisations as well as from\nAnnex I and non-Annex I Parties such as the European Capacity Building Initiative,\nJapan International Cooperation Agency, the German Agency for International\nCooperation (GIZ) and the China-ASEAN workshop organized by China.",
    "At the sub-national level, the states of Johor and Melaka have received capacitybuilding from the United Kingdom Prosperity Fund’s Future Cities Programme and the\nJapanese Joint Crediting Mechanism’s City to City Collaboration for Building Energy\nMonitoring and Reporting System.",
    "7.4 Needs\nMalaysia is only beginning to report on its progress on NDC implementation and\nadditional technical capacity-building and financial assistance would be needed to\ndevelop systems to track its NDC implementation and cooperative approaches (Article\n6 of the Paris Agreement).",
    "Needs for external financial, technical/technology and capacity-building support in the\nthematic areas of GHG inventories, mitigation and adaptation had been identified by\nthe proponent agencies and nationally agreed upon through workshop consultations\nand reviewed by the Technical Working Group on Finance and Needs as well as\nendorsed by the National Steering Committee on Climate Change.",
    "These has been\ndetailed in the BUR4 report.",
    "An estimated amount of USD2.25 million in international funding is required for GHG\ninventory improvement.",
    "To implement the identified mitigation actions, major financial\nsupport is required by the iron and steel industry to the tune of over USD46 million.",
    "For adaptation, a preliminary estimate of USD63.6 million is required for various\ninitiatives to enhance resilience measures throughout the country.",
    "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe completion of Malaysia’s Fourth National Communication was made possible with\nthe contributions, knowledge and expertise of many local scientists, experts and\nindividuals from various governmental agencies, research organisations, nongovernmental organisations, universities and industry organisations.",
